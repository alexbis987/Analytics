Exploring the Power of Pandas for Data Exploration

Project Motivation

I wanted to explore the advantages of using pandas to perform data exploration compared to using excel. 


> I had a distinct set of requirements that were not well-addressed by any single tool at my disposal:
 * Data structures with labeled axes supporting automatic or explicit data alignment. This prevents common errors resulting from misaligned data and working with differently-indexed data coming from different sources
 * Integrated time series functionality.
 * The same data structures handle both time series data and non-time series data.
 * Arithmetic operations and reductions (like summing across an axis) that would be able to maintain the metadata (axis labels).
 * Flexible handling of missing data.
 * Merge and other relational operations found in popular database databases(SQL- based, for example).

 > and... I wanted to be able to do all of these things in one place, preferably in a language well- suited to general purpose software development.
