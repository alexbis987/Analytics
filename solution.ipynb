Though I find it hard to believe that a  third grader, fourth grader, and fifth grader (no matter what country)  could carry on such adult conversations and solve some of these mysteries  (not to mention fight adults and win), it's a cute show and gives a rest  from the every day doldrum of Super Heroes and Mecha.

        "  u'review_text': [u'In the blackest of sunglasses and a polka dot shirt, Dylan, and his musicians, are fabulous in this concert taped in Sony Music Studios on November of 1994, in an intimate setting with a small but enthusiastic audience.From the mellow country feel of \"Shooting Star\", the up-tempo \"Dignity\", or the somber \"With God on Our Side\", the musicianship is a marvel, and being a \"nobody sings Dylan like Dylan\" person, I love the way he sings his music with his gravelly voice that gets rougher as the years go by.The acoustic instruments are a pleasure to listen to, as well as a visual delight, especially the gleaming rich wood of the double bass.This disc contains 4 tracks that were not included in the MTV Unplugged broadcast (# 1, 5, 6 and 8), and total running time is 73 minutes.The terrific musicians are: Tony Garnier on bass, Bucky Baxter on dobro, Winston Watson on drums, John Jackson on guitar and Brendan O\\'Brien on organ.Track list with original release album dates:1: \"Tombstone Blues\" (Highway 61 Revisited \\'65)2: \"Shooting Star\" (Oh Mercy \\'89)3: \"All Along the Watchtower\" (John Wesley Harding \\'67)4: \"The Times They Are A-Changin\\'\" (The Times They Are A-Changin\\' \\'64)5: \"John Brown\" (MTV Unplugged \\'94)6: \"Desolation Row\" (Highway 61 Revisited \\'65)7: Rainy Day Women # 12 & 35\" (Blonde on Blonde \\'66)8: \"Love Minus Zero / No Limit\" (Bringing it All Back Home \\'65)9: \"Dignity\" (Greatest Hits Vol. 3 \\'94)10: \"Knockin\\' on Heaven\\'s Door\" (Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid \\'73)11: \"Like a Rolling Stone\" (Highway 61 Revisited \\'65)12: \"With God on Our Side\" (The Times They Are A-Changin\\' \\'64)',\n",
        "   u'Dylan\\'s more than deserving resurgence in recent years traces its birth back, in my opinion, to this incredible live performance from 1994. This show has it all, mixing old and new music that more than satisfies longtime fans such as myself while also managing to appeal strongly to the younger generation, many of whom would know Dylan only by name had MTV not provided the medium for him to prove his genius and longevity to them first-hand. Dylan\\'s tendency to be reclusive and mysterious has made him inaccessible to some listeners in the past, but the energetically appreciative audience is an important part of this recording, and you can tell that Dylan is really enjoying the whole performance. He even smiles at one point; having seen Dylan perform live, I know just how rare an occurrence this can be.The older songs are great, but they differ significantly from the original recordings (Dylan is constantly redefining and recreating his legendary classics); this may disappoint some fans, and I admit it took me a while to appreciate this particular version of The Times They Are A-Changin\\', but the soul of each song remains the same, no matter what kind of modernized or different interpretation Dylan decides to go with on a certain night. I love Tombstone Blues, and it does start the show off with a great kick. It\\'s always nice to hear Dylan\\'s All Along the Watchtower, if for no other reason than to let people know the song didn\\'t originate with Jimi Hendrix. Rainy Day Women #12 & 35 has never been a favorite of mine, but this version is an enjoyable splash of fun in between a couple of slow, serious songs. John Brown is a significant track, dating back to 1963 but never having been released. It vividly reflects the anti-war feelings Dylan expressed so forcibly in his formative years.  Dylan\\'s newer songs only build on the musical momentum.  I was a little surprised to see Shooting Star from the Oh Mercy album included, but the track looks and sounds great and fits right in. Dignity was a brand new song at the time, standing as a true showcase of Dylan\\'s unparalleled songwriting and performing skills.  He may have aged, but his musical vision and talent are eternal.Three songs particularly stand out to me. Desolation Row is a truly incredible, meaningful song that only Dylan could write and perform. Lasting more than eight minutes, it\\'s the kind of song you never want to end. Knockin\\' on Heaven\\'s Door really starts building the momentum that reaches its crescendo with my favorite Dylan performance ever of his greatest song, Like a Rolling Stone. Having wowed his audience for close to an hour, Dylan is definitely \"feeling it\" when he gets to this crowd-pleasing classic (after a rather humorous false start). Its length is matched only by its powerful delivery, and I get the feeling watching it that even Dylan is a little surprised at how great a show he is putting on.  He is absolutely on fire, and he knows it.  With God On Our Side is an interesting song with which to end the show, but it reflects the heart and soul of music\\'s greatest songwriter. Following on the heels of a rocking performance, it reminds the audience that the old Dylan so many have loved for decades is still there, even if his classic songs have been given a fresh overhaul. Having a rather small audience so close to the musicians makes this live performance a true personal triumph for Dylan, and the sense of intimacy between the legendary performer and his fans is powerful and palpable. Dylan never looked or sounded better than he did on this unforgettable night in 1994.  If you saw the performance on MTV, you should know that the DVD contains four bonus songs not included in the television broadcast (as well as one song - Love Minus Zero/No Limit - not included on the CD).  If you already have the CD, buy the DVD as well - the visuals capture the magical effects of the performance in ways the audio cannot. Read more \\u203a',\n",
        "   u\"I have watched music performed, I have listened to music performed, but never have I felt music performed until Bob Dylan.  I have loved him for 30 years and if this video doesn't make you fall in love with Bob Dylan you  never will.  I can watch this video over and over and still not understand  how one man can have so much talent inside.  This video is a must for  anyone who appreciates the man and his lyrics and his unyielding ability to  make you feel his music.\",\n",
        "   u'Bob Dylan shows that he can still performe on the stage.Dylan has never been blessed with a nice and good voice but he whrote history with his  music.It\\'s the music and words that made Bob Dylan great.On this video  Dylan sings like he never did in the 80\\'s.He is coming back and so is his  {new}band.In the mid 80\\'s his concerts was not what you expected.But now on  this video you will see Dylan reborn.Lots of songs who was sung by others  can not reach that spirit like Dylan does on this video.Bob Dylan is always  on tour and the concerts is still growing with it.His last album \"time  out of mind\" will show you that he is still the greatest artist ever.',\n",
        "   u'Dylan concerts are famously uneven: Some are magical, some are dead, but this is one of the magical ones.  Not only are the performances terrific with Dylan upbeat and engaging the audience, but he shows how a performer should age.  Rather than try to recreate the youthful rock and rolling that existed when \"Tombstone Blues\" and \"Like A Rolling Stone\" were recorded, Dylan brings the tempo down and provides arrangements that are different but just as good as the originals.  The best part is the music fits the man singing it, so instead of looking like a middle aged rocker clinging to youth, Dylan has recreated his music to age with him.Dylan\\'s music has always been timeless, and it\\'s wonderful to see he has the creativity and self-awareness to make himself timeless in the vein of BB King, John Lee Hooker, Johnny Cash, Ray Charles, and not a ridiculous looking Mick Jagger pretending he\\'s still twenty-five.'],\n",

        "  u'review_text': [u'It is incredibly rare to find a film adapted from a play that actually works and remains faithful to spirit of the original story.  \"The Glass Menagerie\" is one of the infinitesimally few efforts that manages to do both.  Casting, direction, and acting are superb, with an especially priceless performance by John Malkovich as the poetic but stifled Tom Wingfield.  The entire film is worth watching for his \"opium den\" rant at Joanne Woodward, though the remainder is in no way lacking.  This is a much underrated, gut-wrenching, true cinematic treasure.',\n",
        "   u\"Of the numerous interpretations of this play that I've seen on stage and screen, this is the best--a strong statement considering the many excellent actors who've been attracted to Tennessee Williams's powerful characters (e.g. Katherine Hepburn and Sam Waterston).  John Malkovich seems to have been born to play Tom, the artist torn between familial duties and wanderlust.  Malkovich's intense and percussive style is an ideal match for Williams's play, in which the text and its poetry dominate.  His performance in this role is the most convincing of any I've seen, and avoids the pitfall of allowing Tom to become too morose and self-absorbed.  Joanne Woodward is also perfect as Amanda, who, though deluded, narrow, and even stupid, holds her family together through her unique mixture of courage and desperation.  Karen Allen and James Naughton also capture what I think Williams must have intended in the characters Laura Wingfield and the gentlemen caller, and the two generate real chemistry in the pivotal scene with the glass unicorn.  This is a must-see for anyone interested in American theater.\",\n",
        "   u'A near-perfect film version of a downright gloomy play, \"The Glass Menagerie\" successfully captures the atmosphere of futility and hopelessness that permeated the play and made it such a success. The choice  of actors is quite good, and I am thankful that the complete plot was  preserved, rather than attempting to alter it in favor of a more active  storyline. Eccentric, yes, depressing, yes, effective - quite so.',\n",
        "   u'The depth of feeling manifested in the acting on display here easily trumps both the (wildly miscast)Gertrude Lawrence and the (vastly overrated) Katherine Hepburn versions of this celebrated play.Though everyone involved (on both sides of the camera) does a first rate job, special accolades are due to Joanne Woodward, who is perhaps the first actress to really understand Amanda, since the role\\'s originator--Laurette Taylor.The pathos in Miss Woodward\\'s delineation of the character is almost unbearable on some occasions, as in the famous jonquil soliloquy, in which she conveys, with hushed voice and beatific eyes, a sentimental recollection for lost time (and lost love) that is not only wholly personally convincing, but also manages to imprint her sentiment onto the audience with all the deja vu of Proust\\'s madeleine.Her Amanda is never less than fully persuasive.And Mr. Malkovitch, in his final address to the camera, (\"blow out your candles Laura\") achieves effects of the same high order, with emotions so confiding, intimate, and genuine that he leaves viewers of any sensitivity as heartbroken as he is.All told a devastating achievement not to be missed by admirers of Mr. Williams.',\n",
        "   u\"This is the best most intelligent version of St. Tennessee's GLASS MENAGERIE I've ever seen!  There is great humor and tenderness in this version, alonside the heartbreak.  The direction by Paul Newman is subtle and insightful, the artful cinematography by the great Michael Ballhaus gives every scene layers and layers of meaning, and the acting is astounding.  John Malkovich's Tom is achingly brilliant (the semi-literate lump Christian Slater playing Tom/Tennessee on Broadway was absurd) and bursting with resentment and anger and creative potential; Joanne Woodward perfectly inhabits mother Amanda's well-meaning but at times smothering narcissistic love and sing-song nagging and melancholic nostalgia; and then the revelation is Karen Allen (who knew?) whose wounded resigned Laura cannot achieve her mother's ambitions or her brother's cultural curiousity, but who compassionately loves these two human volcanos despite everything.I love these characters---Tom, Laura, and Mother Amanda---and I want to be with them again and again, despite how heart-breaking they are.I only wish this version of GLASS MENAGERIE, which gives oxygen to William's poetry and lets it breathe and live inside us all the more powerfully, will become available on DVD soon!\",\n",
        "   u'This is the best film version of the Tennessee Williams play, and one of the best transfers to film of one of his plays - right up there with the Kazan film of \"A Streetcar Named Desire.\"  I can still visualize so much of this film, it was that powerful - Joanne Woodward\\'s \"jonquils\" speech, Malkovich\\'s opening and closing monologues, Karen Allen\\'s frightened, sensitive and shy portrayal, and James Naughton\\'s kindly, clueless, then sensitive portrayal of the Gentleman Caller.Since Paul Newman\\'s death, can those of us out there who love this movie figure out whom to contact to petition a DVD release of this heart-rending film of Tennessee Williams\\' first masterpiece?'],\n",

        "  u'review_text': [u'\"Electra Glide In Blue\" is easily one of my favourite \"unknown\" films of the 1970\\'s. This was the first (and only) movie directed by rock producer James William Guercio, and in my book it is a top class effort.Robert Blake ( from TV\\'s \"Baretta\" ) plays ex-Marine now Arizona motorcycle cop, John Wintergreen, desperate to trade his Harley Davidson Electra Glide police motorbike in for four wheels and join the Stockman Motors detectives division. That opportunity presents itself soon enough, when Wintergreen comes across a gunned down corpse in an dilapidated shack and the puzzle of was it just suicide, or was it murder. Blinded by the supposed granduer of the detective\\'s role, Wintergreen becomes sorely disheartened to find out that the grass is not always greener on the other side of the hill. Exposed to bigotry, hate and injustice, his lofty opinions of his police superiors quickly crumble as he realises the brutal and impersonal nature of their personalities.The talented and versatile cast is what makes \"Electra Glide in Blue\" really crackle....Billy Green Bush plays Wintergreen\\'s partner \"Zipper\" Davis...an abusive and arrogant police officer who is ultimately so insecure and lonely. The talented actor Mitchell Ryan plays head of detectives Harve Poole, another bombastic and narcisstic man seething with resentment and insecurities wracking his life. Jeannine Riley is the lonely, heartbroken waitress ?Joelene\"....seeking warmth and affection in the arms of the local police officers....and the wonderful character actor, Royal Dano, is the tired and irritable Coroner. Plus, I can\\'t leave out veteran character actor, Elisha Cook Jr., as the half witted desert loner, Willy. In the early 1970\\'s, Guercio had produced several albums for rock group \"Chicago\" and he cast several band members in minor roles in \"Electra Glide\"....trumpeter Lee Loughnane is \"Pig Man\", singer/bassist Peter Cetera plays biker \"Bob Zemko\", guitarist Terry Kath is \"Killer\" ( Kath died tragically in Jan. 1978 from a gun accident ) and session musician David \"Hawk\" Wolinski as the harassed VW minibus driver.Add to this fine cast some spectacular cinematography of the stunning Arizona landscape and a haunting and somewhat foreboding soundtrack...and you have an interesting, thought provoking and powerful film that keep\\'s surprising you right up until the final frames.A worthy addition to your collection of great 1970\\'s films.....

        "   u'Robert Blake plays a diminutive motorcycle cop in the middle of Arizona.  His ambition is to make detective, and wear \"that brown suit and hat that says \\'you get paid to think.\\'\"  When he discovers a suicide that  may be a murder, he gets his shot at the bigtime. I haven\\'t seen every  movie Blake\\'s done, but this is probably his best role, and he really makes  the most of it.  Director Guercio (who, to my knowledge never directed  another movie) paints a beautiful, poignant picture of this little man  surrounded by an awesome landscape.  In a way the desert represents Blake\\'s  situation.  He\\'s this tiny guy who wants to play by a code of honor and to  do the right thing, but all around him is this vast wasteland crawling with  people who want to bend the rules. The final shot of this film, along with  the beautiful closing song (written by Director Guercio) is one of the  saddest, most awe-inspiring moments in the history of filmmaking. This  movie\\'s not a thrill-a-minute chase flick, but a thoughtful, sad and  inspiring story of duty, honor, decency, and the price those virtues bear.',\n",
        "   u\"I had vague memories of seeing this film years ago when I was probably sixteen that had haunted me for the following sixteen years of my life. Having just seen this gem again on cable I remembered why. The acting in this film is so far beyond most of the junk that is released today that the phrase, they don't make them like they used to should be changed to , they can't make them like they used to. While some aspects of a movie of this age might seem a little dated who could reasonably deny that the final scene of this film is the most stunning thing ever exposed to film. Hell I could watch that ending every day for the rest of my life and always be awed by the beauty and sadness of it.\",\n",
        "   u'This film is a disjointed, unfocused, cynical, at times brilliant look at the life of a motorcycle cop in Arizona. Robert Blake plays John Wintergreen, a sympathetic loner and dreamer who aspires to be a detective. The suicide of an old drifter in the desert is quickly seen by Blake as a murder and his attempts to convince his superiors to investigate is met at first with derision. Through Blake\\'s eyes we see a country torn apart: apathetic, neurotic, berift of dreams, lonely, capable of frightening acts of violence. An examination of the mindset of the early seventies and a film that is sometimes know as the \"anti Easy Rider.\" Blake has rarely been better.',\n",
        "   u'This episodic and leisurely paced crime thriller/character study was one of the last of the true \"60\\'s\" films (even though it was released in 1973). The twist here is that the existential anti-hero isn\\'t riding a chopper or racing across America in a Challenger to keep one step ahead of \"The Man\" but in fact IS \"The Man\" --a motorcycle cop! One-shot director James William Guercio, previously known for producing the band Chicago and creating the Caribou Records label, does an admirable job (and leaves one wondering why he didn\\'t continue to pursue filmmaking). Robert Blake delivers his second-best ever perfomance (\"In Cold Blood\" remains his highest watermark) as a highway patrolman yearning for a more glamourous (to his perception, at least) posting as a homicide detective. All the supporting actors are superb, and the expansive cinematography recalls \"Vanishing Point\" and \"Badlands\" with its sweeping vistas of the American West. A sleeper worth a look.'],\n",

        "  u'review_text': [u'When I heard the story line for Before Sunrise, a slacker American played by Ethan Hawke falls in love in Europe with Julie Delpy, I rolled my eyes. But this is a thoughftul and compelling movie that broke down my skeptical and cynical wall. First, the movie takes us through the awkward stages of two people going from being perfect strangers to removing their own walls and falling in love in a way that is never sappy. Using this falling-in-love motif, the director/writer Richard Linklater addresses several profound themes: the nature of time, the conflict between cynicism and romance, the obsession with death, the shortcomings of \"adulthood.\" The dialogue between Hawke and Delpy is philosophical but never too abstract; it seems to stem from their well-drawn characters. I suppose there\\'s a parallel between the breaking down of my own cynicism and the characters\\'. They have been hurt by life, have put up their walls, and, through their discussions, they have gradually removed those walls so that by the movie\\'s end you think it\\'s a crime if they don\\'t fall in love and live happily ever after. But the movie is more complex than a happy ending. The movie forces you to ask if their love would survive if removed from the brief ecstasy of their single day (and night) together. Is the brevity the cause of their ecstasy? Would a life of marriage disintigrate into the mundane? The characters struggle with these questions in what is my favorite romantic movie.',\n",
        "   u'At first, I was surprised I was even watching this movie.  I\\'m older now.  Been married for 20 years.  Not really into \"chick flicks\" but something about the dialog between these two young people caught my attention when I surfed into this movie.  These kids were truly something.  The young lady was everything I would want my daughter to be.  Smart, articulate, pretty, honest, independent and sensible.  She was a lot of fun to listen to.  The boy was honorable and really seemed to care for this girl.  I hope my sons treat the women they fall in love with with the same respect.  Why would a middle age guy like me like this movie?  I think it took me back to a time where I remember feeling the magic and excitment from meeting someone for the first time.  It was pretty nice to feel this again for a short time.  I guess I forgotten how it felt to be so intrigued by someone that nothing else in the world mattered.  It was rare to have this feeling and something that we will all remember when it does happen....or something we would want to experience again.  It\\'s like a gift.  It reminded me of that Neil Young song Like a Hurricane.....\"...that magic moment right before you kissed my lips, time just slips....\".  I hope I remeber the words right.  This is truly an excellent movie with great dialog.  A true gem in a world of rotten, corny movies minus the breast shots and gratuitous sex scenes.  None of that in this movie.  Just a very honest and natural progression in a short-term relationship that both charactures really appreciate.This is just a very good movie.  Perhaps one of the best I have ever seen.  Not sure why it\\'s rated \"R\".  Perhaps some of the language but I have heard worse in my son\\'s Jr. High School.Watch this movie and experience a wonderful feeling that you probably haven\\'t experienced in years  or maybe never experienced but want to.  It makes this guy appreciate the woman that I have a little bit more than I did.',\n",
        "   u'In a world where characters seem to cautiously approach a tentative friendship before diving into an impulsive romantic relationship, it is almost refreshing to see both happening at once. From the moment American Jesse meets the luminous French Celine there is a soul connection that defies definition.At first, Celine seems to overwhelm Jesse with her intellectual wanderings and yet she playfully allows him to tease her. The chemistry is phenomenal and the sheer beauty of various scenes made me realize how the simplicity of the settings actually enhanced the emotional aspects.Throughout the entire movie you never feel that you are on the outside looking in, although I think that is the underlying attraction. I was so mesmerized by the script I felt I became each character as they were speaking. This is bliss for anyone who loves the sheer honesty of life itself. Jesse and Celine delve into philosophy, creatively describe their first romantic feelings and enjoy a spontaneous merging of the minds.When they meet on a train heading to Vienna, neither imagine they will encounter a reality that is better than any fantasy. There is a sweet innocence pervading this entire movie with an underlying erotic tension that never seems to find complete fulfillment on screen. While the ending of this movie is more melancholy, the ending of Before Sunset is more than delicious.~The Rebecca Review',\n",
        "   u'Can you think of another film and sequel that are as uniformly excellent? I sure can\\'t. \"Before Sunrise\" and \"Before Sunset\" are each jewels in their own right.I saw \"Before Sunrise\" when it came out in 1995 and fell head over heels. Some films become instant favorites but lose their luster after repeated viewings through the years -- it\\'s natural for our response to change as we age and evolve. But with true movie classics, our affection only grows. \"Before Sunrise\" is one of those. It has remained among my favorite films these past nine years, and subsequent viewings have brought just as much, if not more, delight and wonder.Unfortunately, I\\'ve been less than thrilled with Richard Linklater\\'s subsequent films -- particularly \"Waking Life,\" which I thought was pretentious and annoying (despite animated cameos by Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy).So, I approached \"Before Sunset\" with both trepidation and excitement. Amazingly, the sequel is just as enjoyable and satisfying as the first. The tone is somewhat different, as you would expect because of the characters\\' greater maturity and share of disappointments. The performances, script and direction remain perfect.These are the most European American films I can think of, and yes, that\\'s a compliment. (Sometimes, you almost expect to see subtitles.) They are particularly reminiscent of Eric Rohmer\\'s films in that they rely on real-time effects and lengthy conversations to tap into what it means to be human and connect with others. And in fact, if you love the \"Before\" movies and you don\\'t mind subtitles, you might want to also check out Rohmer films like \"Boyfriends and Girlfriends\" and \"Summer.\"The \"Before Sunrise\" and \"Before Sunset\" DVDs have excellent picture quality. There are no extras to speak of, except for a short behind-the-scenes documentary on the \"Before Sunset\" DVD. At first, I was disappointed, but then I realized that adding a commentary or deleted scenes to either film might only risk taking away some of the magic. Both movies stand on their own. They are, in my opinion, the most perfectly realized romantic films in American movie history, bar none. Read more \\u203a'],\n",

I teach South American Social Studies at roughly the same time our building Science teacher is teaching a unit on biomes.  This video connects the two in a very nice way.  Not only does the video focus on the life of the anaconda, it focuses on the other animals and the features of the llanos itself.  The animal footage can be quite graphic at times, but does a wonderul job displaying the harsh reality of animal life.  National Geographic doesn't try to sugar-coat the reality of the animal kingdom, like some videos do.  The snake footage is also very good.  I recommend this video for anybody interested in anacondas, the wildlife of the llanos and the llanos itself.\",\n",

        "  u'review_text': [u'This is an oddly touching film despite its ostensibly disjointed plot, which is replete with a send-up of the coldest of the \"cool\" Steve McQueen personas (in \"Bullett\"), plus a teasing parody of Altman\\'s own \"M*A*S*H\" sequence in which Sally Kellerman is humiliated in the shower. (This time she is revealed bathing in a public fountain!) The film posits a definite yearning for innocence and escape from the gross cruelties and disappointments of the Vietnam War era through the young Brewster McCloud\\'s attempt to fly as a bird -- of sorts. However, he can only do this if he maintains his own sexual innocence (a very traditional religious concept, by the way), and he doesn\\'t, of course, and so is betrayed by a callow (and callous) \"Eve\" -- portrayed by one of Altman\\'s favorite performers, Shelley Duvall, in her debut. Sally Kellerman, by the way, is a really beautiful, touching \"bird-woman,\" who is Brewster\\'s personal \"angel\"; Bud Cort is a gentle but naive hero (despite being a mass murderer!), and the film only seems to run along without care for the plot, for it is actually a well-crafted story of a futile attempt to \"regain Paradise\" by \"flying away\" from our cruelly competitive and facile culture. It finishes very enigmatically, yet tragically, for it is also a symbolic account of the failure of the 1960s \"youth rebellion.\" Not among the \"best\" of Altman -- \"McCabe and Mrs. Miller\" is the better depiction of American decay, and \"Nashville\" is Altman\\'s quirky yet perceptive study of U. S. politics -- but I can\\'t get it out of my head: it makes me sad and full of yearning myself....',\n",
        "   u\"Robert Altman made Brewster McCloud around the same time as his acclaimed MASH was released, but for some reason this has been forgotten over time. Revealing any of the story would be useless because the film is so utterly absurd it wouldn't make sense. The comedy ranges from bird poop on dead bodies to a supporting character who's a direct spoof of Steve McQueen's 'Bullitt.' Weird, silly, oddly sexual, and hilarious. Not for all tastes, but worth a look if you're up for something very, very different. A DVD release would be terrific, especially if Altman gave a commentary.*** out of ****\",\n",
        "   u\"BREWSTER MCCLOUD concerns a young man (Bud Cort; he was Harold, in HAROLD AND MAUDE) who lives in a room inside the Houston Astrodome, and dreams of flight.  He spends his time photographing birds and designing wings, in the hopes that he can take to the air as a bird does.  A second plotline involves a serial killer, a performer of strangulation murders, loose in Houston.  The HPD have called in Shaft, a hotshot San Francisco detective, to help solve the case.  Each of the victims is found with bird excrement on his face.  Of course, our naive and physically slight Brewster is the killer.  A film of bizarre plot and presumptively a satire, BREWSTER MCCLOUD does not approach the mastery of Robert Altman's other films of the period, particularly MASH and MCCABE AND MRS. MILLER.  Occasionally the dialogue is very funny, but too often the director chose to impress the viewer with a skewed sensibility which leaves much to be desired. Inconsistent shots and the lack of a consistent structure probably leaves many viewers reeling.  Similarities to other Altman films abound, but most easily spotted are the terrific ensemble cast, the familiar players from other Altman films, such as Rene Auberjonois, G. Wood, Kellerman, and Duvall, and the use of voice-over throughout the movie.  The police radio, in this case, takes the job of the intercom announcer in MASH, and provides a useful way of moving the plot along.  Not quite for Altman completists only, I'd recommend this to all Robert Altman fans, fans of Harold and Maude, and fans of bizarre movies.  In a sense this is a black comedy.  Not depressing in the least, it represents a rare, brave attempt to make a unique motion picture.  While it doesn't work on a number of levels, various strange elements stand out to make BREWSTER MCCLOUD a movie worth seeing.  ken32\",\n",
        "   u'The first time I saw this movie I walked away thinking \"i never want to see that again...\"  The reason why was that this film leaves the viewer feeling depressed for days.  Although the plot has it\\'s holes, it is ultimately unimportant.  It\\'s the characters themselves that make this film.  Both Duvall and Kellerman are captivating while the protagonist embodies that little part of us all that wants to just disappear from time to time.  It\\'s not a great film...it\\'s good though and it will stick with you long after the credits roll.',\n",
        "   u'What happened to the days when late-night TV was the province of small, oddball films?  That\\'s where I discovered Brewster McCloud, a youth alienated from society who is looked after by a guardian angel (Sally Kellerman) who warns him against the venal temptations of the world (women).  Alas, Brewster meets Shelley Duvall, and madness ensues.  I bought the video after many years, but thought that this would be one of those quirky films that I liked only owing to my youthful ignorance.  Hah!  The avian metaphors, though obvious, are amusing--as in the \"flying cars\" chase scene and rene auberjonois\\'s evolution--Michael Murphy is terrific as the ultimate cool, blue-eyed but anti-establishment cop--margaret hamilton and stacey keach have great cameos as hideously unlikeable but funny (they get theirs) cameos, and the early altman players--john shuck, bud cort, et al...--are terrific.  For those looking for non-commercial entertainment, Brewster McCloud is unique and intelligent in a manic, frivolous, sort of way.?'],\n",

I find that it\\'s now one of my all-time favorite Peanuts videos, a very close second to \"A Charlie Brown Christmas\" (the sentimental favorite). Your kids won\\'t even realize that they are learning about Arbor Day or helping preserve green space because the message is so seamlessly integrated into the fun. The plot is simple: the gang decides to turn Charlie Brown\\'s baseball field into a park in honor of Arbor Day. There are so many priceless moments: when Snoopy gets ejected from the library for laughing too hard at doggie obedience texts; Snoopy\\'s fight with the creeping vine; Peppermint Patty\\'s attempt to get Charlie Brown to explain love to her; Lucy\\'s first home run; Patty trying to pitch around a tree that has been planted on the pitcher\\'s mound; Sally\\'s mistaken pronouncement that Arbor Day is \"when all the ships come into the Arbor.\" Buy it, watch it, then go out and plant a tree with your kids!',\n",
        "   u'I remember when this 1st came out- at 9 years old, I had no idea what Arbor Day was all about (no, it\\'s not \"the day all the ships come sailing into the arbor\", as Sally Brown guesses in class and gets  laughed at!).  Peppermint Patty challenges old Chuck to a game at his new  field, which looks more like a garden than a baseball field (not exactly  Peppermint Patty\\'s idea of a perfect field)!  Lucy makes poor Schroeder  promise her a kiss if she hits a home run!  Note: this was Vince Guaraldi\\'s  final Peanuts score as he would pass away the following year.',\n",
        "   u\"Although not as well known as some of the other Peanuts classics, this one stands up with the rest of them, and surpasses many. The full cast is there, along with Vince Guaraldi's final musical score (he died right after completion of this project).\",\n",

        "  u'review_text': [u\"Upon theatrical release this film received many bad reviews, mostly by people who thought they were protecting the reputations of the novel and the 1946 cinematic version.  Unfortunately, these reviews unfairly criticized what is a fine film and one that faithfully recreates the central themes of the book.  Let's face it, in many ways, Great Expectations can be a dreary book.  The many plot twists and turns, while typical of Dickens, merely provide a framework for the core concerns of  the book: class inequities, the allure and dangers of retribution, the pain of unrequited love, the human heart's capacity to harden itself, the conflict between the environment and the innate, society's willingness to sacrifice its children, and the power of loyalty and forgiveness, to name a few.  This adaptation deals directly with these issues and forsakes unnecessary plot devices.  Remember, Dickens published his novel serially for a public who anxiously awaited new installments and wanted many of them.  A modern film audience has no interest in such prolonged dramas.  This movie wisely does away with what it does not need.  And yet, many of the criticisms point to these omissions as evidence of a failed narrative.  What these criticisms reveal is their critics' misinterpretation of the novel's strengths and misunderstanding of modern cinema.This is a fine film, and it is well worth watching for reasons outlined in other positive reviews: the performances, the cinematography, the soundtrack, and the emotional impact.\",\n",
        "   u'\"Great Expectations\" (1998) This film is a cinematic masterpiece due to its colorful scenes that seem to be painted onto the screen in a perfectly precise style.  \"Great Expectations\" is  rich with imagery and a wonderful story line based on Charles Dickens\\'  classic tale.  It strays from the novel enough to make the story a more  visual experience.  The time period is changed to present day, but this  adaptation works for the best.  It allows a modern audience to identify  with this classic tale in a way that would be impossible if the film were  set in the 19th century.  Finnegan Bell falls hopelessly in love with  Estella from the first moment he lays eyes on her and proceeds throughout  his life in continual pursuit of her love by attempting to become  \"worthy\" of her.  He is an orphan raised by his abusive sister  and her fisherman husband, Joe.  Estella is the niece of the richest lady  in the state, Ms. Nora Diggers Dinsmoor.  Ms. Dinsmoor requests Finn\\'s  presence at her mansion, Paradiso Perduto, on a weekly basis as a playmate  for Estella and to entertain herself.  Ms. Dinsmoor was left at the altar  by her fianc\\xe9e in prior years and has become a bitter old lady who scorns  all men and believes none can be worthy of a woman\\'s love.  She schools  Estella in this manner, which explains Estella\\'s cold behavior and her  rejection of Finn as anything more than a toy for her to play with his  emotions.  The story is told through Finn\\'s eyes and from his  perspective on what occurs as he grows up and learns about life.  He has  the ability to paint fabulously, a gift he has had since birth, and he uses  this gift to express himself and his emotions throughout his life.  It  becomes a road to success and to Estella, but he loses sight of his joy and  love for the art.  Success becomes a trap for him when he realizes that  there is more to life than himself and his own feelings.  He truly grows up  and even though he always loves Estella, learns what he wants out of life  and how to accomplish it.  \"Great Expectations\" is  wonderfully cast, with Ethan Hawke doing an extraordinary job as the  lovelorn Finn.  He is believable and invokes much sympathy from the  audience.  Gwyneth Paltrow is superb as Estella, who conjures some  hostility because of her rejection of Finn, but at the same time is capable  of evoking sympathy.  The way she acts is not her fault because she does  not know any better.  Robert De Niro puts in an excellent performance as  the escaped convict who scares Finn as a young boy and has a major  influence on his life.  Anne Bancroft is wonderful as the eccentric Ms.  Dinsmoor who acts out her hostility towards men through Estella.  This  film is one of the most picturesque and beautifully cinematic films I have  ever seen.  From the first scene until the last, each shot is carefully  stylized to make the most of the scenery and the story.  The theme of  Finn\\'s paintings is begun in the opening credits, with his paintings as the  background and the credits appearing on the screen as if in rippling water.  Each shot is precisely stylized to evoke certain emotions from the  audience and to tell the story as Finn remembers it.  The film looks as  though many different paintings were put together to create a coherent  story.  The film is very peaceful, as seen through Finn\\'s paintings and the  slow, romantic musical background, but at times is jarred to reality by the  people coming into Finn\\'s life who influence him.  The film can appear as  if in a dream state while Finn is thinking about certain occurrences in his  life, but then an event happens that shows him just how large and  threatening the world is capable of being.  This gives him to a new  understanding of the world and his place within it.  This tragic tale  is given an optimistic Hollywood ending, but in my opinion, this is  appropriate.  It leaves some hope, even though small, of Finn reaching his  ultimate goal in life of finding himself and being free of the past,  \"like love, completely undeserved\". Read more \\u203a',\n",
        "   u\"This movie was a work of art in itself with a  gorgeous sountrack, breathtaking cinematography, beautiful artwork, and perfect timing.  However, if you are looking for a movie that stays true to the original  novel or deep character development, look elsewhere.  Great Expectations  the movie is simply a very slicked over and glossed up layman's version of  Dicken's masterpiece.  In any case, I enjoyed it very much and think it is  worth purchasing.\",\n",
        "   u\"Those who say that this movie is an insult to the spirit of the book by Dickens are completely missing the point.  Textuality dictates that reciting the same story that was amazing in print will turn out contrived  and vacuous in celluloid.  It shows the spirit of Dickens' work -  completely loss in spite of danger, the loss of heart and being.  It's a  story that hinges on that great tragic moment in love which Romeo and  Juliet made so clear to us all (esp. in Shakespeare in Love).The movie  is rich in narration and exploits a directorial narrative.  The ebb and  flow of visions, places, people, and unrelated occurrences turn into a  melange which has all the warped lucidity of one's best and most painful  memories.  The direction is fantastic as is the cinematography. The  greatest genius of this movie is the use of the hauntingly frozen Life in  Mono by Mono.  Regrettably, this portishead-ish band's other songs didn't  have quite the presence of this song that gave the movie its icy  ambience.Especially loved the Dinsmore character.  Much more batty and  manipulative than the simply grotesque and warped Havisham of the  book.Additionally, the recounting of Gwyneth (Estella) may seem flat and  one-dimensional; however, isn't that the way one remembers the players in  one's memories - as automata which reacted to us singularly in the stage of  life?It's an amazing film.\"],\n",

        "  u'review_text': [u\"Cary Grant was born in Bristol, England. His father put his mother in an  insane asylum when young Archie Leach (his name at the time) was only a  boy. Grant grew up without a mother, and when he read the script for the  movie, frinds of his such as Frank Sinatra, and Gregory Peck siad he was  overjoyed, and throughout the film's production, too.  Cary really  got to display some emotions in the film he was never given a chance to in  real life until he was an adult.  Ethyl Barrymore's outstanding, Oscar  winning  performance made it all the more easier for Cary to show his  feelings.  Cary was very excited when he took everyone he knew to the  film's premier, but after, all were stunned at the dark, sombre mood of the  film. The Oscars agreed with Cary, however, and gave him his second and  last nomination... but of course he was stiffed because the Acadamey Awards  are often ridiculous.  A young cockney drifter returns home to help  out his poor mother in time of need.  The film is very sad, and grave,  and sombre. There is nothing else like it in the Grant filmography,  although his dramatic turns are always his best roles.  So dark and  grimy, richly dteailed, beautifully filmed, wonderfully acted, cleverly  written, and carefully directed, this is one of the greatest films ever  made, certainly in the Grant top five, and the all around top ten or  fifteen.  Those who know Grant and have any brains at all will be  almost shocked by this wonderful display of how motion pictures can truly  affect us.\",\n",
        "   u'Clifford Odets wrote and directed this movie.  Naturally, it follows the type of dramatic lines that you would expect from a playwright.  I disagree with Leonard Maltin\\'s review.  This is a very fine movie and well worth any  drama lover\\'s attention.Cary Grant is very good in his role as Ernie  Mott.  Ethel Barrymore plays his mother in the movie and she is riveting  and marvelous. Barry Fitzgerald is his usual fine self.  The actor who  played Jim Mordinoy--Coulouris I believe--had his character down to a  finely honed edge.  A truly memorable heavy.  June Duprez who played Ada  was superb.  She was lovely, eloquently honest, and terrifically  sexy.For me it\\'s hard to do much better than a Clifford Odets script.  His dialogue always seems to sparkle with intelligence, wit, and a hard won  wisdom that hasn\\'t had all of its innocence destroyed by a brutal  world.The theme of the movie seems to revolve around a line that Ernie  says a couple of times.  Something to the effect that:  \"In this world  you\\'re either the fox or the hound.  But what if you don\\'t want to be  either the fox or the hound?  What then?\"  Or something along those  lines.  Ernie\\'s task in this movie is express his love for his mother and  Ada and also to find a \"decent life\" in this world.  The  script and the cinemaphotography reflect a gray and bleak picture of the  struggle for survival by working class people in the England of the  30\\'s--shortly before the outbreak of WWII.  It\\'s really a typical  Odets\\'critique of the brutality and heartlessness of western society.  Regardless of your politics, though, if you like fine drama and brilliant  dialogue, catch this movie.  It won\\'t lift you up, but it should educate  your heart--the lonely one that is. ...',\n",
        "   u\"As a boy growing up in England and having an estranged relationship with his mother, I believe this was his way of going back to his roots and being the son he so desperately wanted to be. He gives an air of hominess to the  movie. It really seemed like he could have been living the part.  You can  also tell that there was a lot of raw emotion pent up inside of him that he  didn't let just anyone see in his other comedic roles, this one was very  close to his heart, and being a Cary Grant fanatic, I like the fact that he  let everyone see a glimpse of his real self behind all of the glitz and  glamour of hollywood. It took guts to relive the old memories.\",\n",
        "   u\"NONE BUT THE LONELY HEART (1944)This is a very emotionally draining film. What spectactular performances by Grant, Barrymore, Wyatt and Duprez. Cary Grants restless drifter really makes you feel his frustration with life and society in pre ww2 England. Duprez is lovely as the target of a ruthless crime bosses not so innocent affections. She is a kindred spirit to Cary that sees him for the decent but troubled guy he really is.Wyatt is charming as the female friend of Grant that hoplessly and not too secretly longs for him. However, the real treat in this movie is the dynamic between Grant as the son and Ethel Barrymore as the mother desperate to get him on the right path, even if it destroys her.There is a wonderful scene when she buys Grant a new suit and they sit down to dinner together. He knows her secret that she's trying to keep from him and the facial reactions of both of them are highly emotional. His final scene with her is nothing less than gut wrenching. Grant restlessly wanders the streets at night. The cinematography, the rain and the gray color palette helps relay to the viewer Grants feelings of being closed in, clausterphobic and his sense of futility about his life.Another great pleasure in this film is Cary Grants friendship with the Barry Fitzgerald character, dispensing helpful bits of wisdom. Excellent entertainment and easliy one of Grants best performances, as well as Barrymores.Obviously, I highly recommend this movie.\"],\n",

        "  u'review_text': [u'I have been using this tape faithfully for 3 months and have really seen results!  This tape is great for beginners-intermediate who would like an all-over body workout.  It is a medium paced workout w/weights. Denise  Austin is very motivational and keeps you going.  It is set at the beach  and about 45 min long. I also like this tape because you do one super set  instead of 3-4 sets which get boring.  I recommend this to anyone who wants  to get tone.',\n",
        "   u\"By using this video, you will enjoy a good toning workout which can be easily increased in intensity by using heavier weights. Beware, though, of two things: 1) it is just over 45-minutes, and you MUST do the entire video (including warm-up and cool-down) or you will feel the pain! 2) there is one excercise in it that really requires a bench. I don't have one, but I substitute for it by doing another excerise. For all else, all you need are hand weights and a chair. Very fun!\",\n",
        "   u\"I have been using this tape twice a week since January and think it's pretty good overall. Denise seems to cover every part of the body. She does talk incessantly, but she really motivates me to keep trying when I feel like resting. It is a little boring, but oh, well.  I think it's worth it.  Here's why. . . Before using this tape, I just walked (speed walking) regularly 5-6 times a week.  When I've had fat analyses done in the past five years, I never did that well even though my body weight has been in an excellent range.  Without changing anything else and keeping a stable weight, I had another fat analysis last month after 6 months of using the tape.  My fat analysis was in the good range this time because I have more muscle now. So that was enough to encourage me to keep using the tape!  My doctor said that weight training is really excellent for keeping bone mass as we grow older (I'm 41 now.), and that's why I ordered this tape.  I think the price is excellent for what you get.\",\n",
        "   u\"Great overall toning - the more weights you use, the better your shape. She's diverse in her routines as you admire the beach in the background. Denise Austin uses many routines including a bench (I use a table) and explains how your muscles react by certain exercises and their benfits. The video take a full 45 minutes from warm up to cool down but you'll notice better body tone in just the first few times you work out (even if you dont' make it all the way through). I definitely recommend.\",\n",
        "   u\"I was pleasantly surprised by this video, I happened to rent Denise's Sizzler workout from the library which contained snippets of Totally Firm, based on that I decided to order it. I am glad that I did. I haven't seen much of Denise's videos as I use mainly the Firm and others but was impressed by this one. It is a solid 45 minute weight training routine, Denise hits all the muscle groups at least once and even includes calf and rotator cuff work. You work your legs with squats, static lunges and plie squats, plus calf lifts and leg lifts while sitting on the bench. For arms you will see bicep curls, overhead presses for shoulders, triceps kickbacks and tricep dips using a bench, front and side shoulder raises, bench press, pec flies and pushups for chest and some ab work. Denise uses a 2-2 count for all the exercises, she uses 5lb weights. I used anywhere from 5-12lb weights, the controlled pace of the reps allows for you to lift heavy if you choose to. The only negative is the counts are uneven for the exercises, some exercises there are 12-13 reps, others are 16-18 reps. It would have been nice if they were all 12 reps or 16 reps. But that was a minor irritation in an otherwise good workout. This is a workout that you can grow with too, which is a plus.Denise has 2 people exercising with her, Jeff and Kelly who is a personal trainer with great form. The setting is on a beach in Mexico overlooking the ocean, very pretty. You can also hear the ocean waves crashing which I thought was neat, the music is nothing spectacular but not bad either. I felt that it suited the workout well. Denise offers a lot of good pointers in this workout, and she looks great as well. She is still her perky self with her funny comments, but not over the top at all. I thought she did a great job.If you are looking to add one Denise video to your collection, this is it. A lot of reviews I have read state this is the best one she has come out with, I would agree with that 100%.\",\n",
        "   u\"I just bought this as my very first workout video and I absolutely love it ! I do it early in the morning when it's still cool and the beach background makes me feel as if I'm there and not in my living room! I'm a runner and I feel this is good cross training to help make me stronger.  This video is deceiveing because I started out with 3lb wts. thinking I wouldn't feel a thing yet I definitely do feel the burn in my muscles throughout the day.  For those of you who may be runners also or really into cardio - this video is a great warmup. It's a good morning or mid afternoon energizer to do before you do your cardio workouts. This video is a good supplement to a regular exercise program - but I don't feel like it's a cure for all.  Definitely do some other cardio on your own if you want major results quicker.  Despite all the good things this has to offer my only major drawback is that you don't get a good sweat although you know you're workin' it ! !\"],\n",

        "  u'review_text': [u\"I originally rented this movie only because I am a Diahann Carroll fan, but after watching the first few minutes of it, I knew that I was going to like it whether her part was big or not.It begins with a family that is struggling to make it on their own after the father leaves them.  The daughter's goat 'makes friends' with the neighbors goat and it inadvertently brings both families together.It explores personal relationships among family and friends as everyone struggles to fight their prejudices and pains of the past.If you're in the mood for a good story of friendship and a reminder of what really makes a family (and I don't mean genetics), then this movie is for you.  I highly recommend it.\",\n",
        "   u\"I've watched this movie a few times and it's truly wonderful. The cast is charming and loaded with talent (especially the children). Helen Shaver's character is especially inspiring and well done. She plays an extremely hard-working woman who has been dealt a very difficult hand. Instead of moping and whining and bitterly lamenting her fate (like most of us would), she quietly summons her strength and gets through each demanding day with dignity, courage and a deep love for her children. Great viewing experience for the entire family.Why is there no DVD?\",\n",

When two goats accidently get together and bring a two completly different families together it is an amazing story of laughter, sadness, tragidy and togetherness. A movie that  everyone should see as a family. The story of love, hate, disrespect and  respect. A must see movie.',\n",

        "  u'review_text': [u'I\\'m surprised this never took off. I found this in my library recently.Instructor Debra Minghi is called an \"alternative\" fitness professional on the cover of this vhs. Minghi\\'s background is modern dance (she studied with Bob Fosse, toured with A Chorus Line, and choreographed routines for MTV) & she uses this experience in her 53-minute workout. I love her, she\\'s fun, vivacious, enthusiastic, really reminds you to let go \"shake your booty\" & is a great teacher. She breaks down all the moves, going 1/2-3/4 speed lower body only, then upper body only then both, then full tempo (her normal is 50% faster then when you see those moves done on tv. This makes it easy to pick up even the first time almost, some moves more complex & take a few viewings to get it perfect, but it will be fun. She even gives great body cues & even tells you which muscles are being used. Even though you go half speed, your heart rate never has a chance to go back to normal, she keeps you moving.The set is a club, with lights everywhere, a live dj in the back & always playing REAL songs w/real singing WOW!. There are 4 girls & 2 guys in great shape behind Debra, \"I can\\'t hear you!!!\" all dancing. The camera moves well, is professional & with effects to make everything look even more stylish but overall keeps on Debra as good or better then most fitness dvds.Intro - 2 min - telling you to enjoy yourself, let go, etc.Warm-up - 9 min - This alone is wroth it.. it\\'s fun, she gets all the good spots with the large arm movements, head turns, hip swivels, etc.Combo #1 - 10 min - She teaches as I said above & after doing the \"routine\" once after being taught, she goes through it again slow 1x & then fast for each move again.Combo #2 - 10 min - same thing, this one has 2 heart rate checksCombo #3 - 13 min - slow then fast practice of the # 1 & #2 combos you learned a couple of timesCool Down - 7 min - slower, relaxed pace stretching of hips, torso, arms, a lot of plies w/haunting female singing of a song playing that\\'s beautifulShe calls the slow speed downtown & fast uptown, but her uptown is like 50% faster then most dancers you see even on tv, so it\\'s a little hard to keep up & doesn\\'t feel right to go THAT fast but she\\'s still a lot of fun. I hope other dance instructors take a cue from her lively, in the moment, letting go style, breakdown of moves & detailed cuing.Theres another review on videofitness com Read more \\u203a',\n",

Bandit is without a doubt the cutest cartoon dog in cartoon history and both these episodes are completely different.First the dramtic and rather terrifying TERROR ISLAND where the Quest team goes to Hong Kong to investigate sightings of giant mutant monsters.  Definetly for a more mature cartoon audience as a man is shot and killed right in front of our eyes.  Things then go to loveable and cute as ATTACK OF THE TREEPEOPLE is played.  Jonny Hadji and Bandit are lost at see and stranded on an island with a bunch of funny apes and two stereotypical  evil Austrailian hunters Silky and Chopper.Definetly worth it to very different episodes one cute and one grewsome.  This really shows why this cartoon was so great.  Highly recommended!',\n",
        "   u\"I do not usually review VHS releases that are over a decade old, but this really was a nice set. There were only four tapes in the set but they really captured the best of the series. In fact, if you can't afford the full 26 episode DVD release (and you still have a VHS player) these tapes are still an excellent review or introduction to the classic 1964 series. They were digitally remastered so they are bright and sharp to watch with clear, full sound. It's funny, but in some ways they seem more modern, and optimistic, than anything being produced these days. They really predicted an incredible amount of present day technology.1) Race Bannon in An Army of One includes: Mystery of the Lizard Men, and Double Danger, plus a Space Ghost cartoon (Heat Thing.)2) Dr. Zin in Master of Evil includes: Riddle of the Gold, and The Robot Spy, plus a Space Ghost cartoon (Creature King.)3) Hadji in Mysteries of the East includes: Calcutta Adventure, and Pirates from Below, plus a Space Ghost Cartoon (Revenge of the Spider Woman.)4) Bandit in Adventures Best Friend includes Attack of the Tree People, and Terror Island, plus a Space Ghost Cartoon (Zorak.)\",\n",

        "  u'review_text': [u'I have always really liked this movie since it came out in 1973.  I have watched it countless times through the years on TV, but haven\\'t seen it for a while on TV so I picked it up on DVD.  Although the DVD doesn\\'t offer a lot of features, the picture quality is good and it\\'s presented in it\\'s original cinemascope format.  This was one of the higher budget \"blaxploitation\" flicks from the \\'70s.  Seeing it as a kid I thought it was the coolest movie.  Now that I am a lot older, it\\'s still cool, but in a campy/fun way.  The plot consists of a government agent named Cleopatra Jones (Tamara Dobson)who is hired to rid the US of drugs.  She goes after one of the \"Queenpins\" of the drug trade called Mommy, played by Shelley Winters.  The one thing I never forgot about this movie was Cleopatra\\'s kickin\\' Corvette complete with a cassette deck, which was really high-end at the time! (Most cars had 8-track players) Along with this was her funky fashions!  If you like the \\'70s action genre, this is a great addition to your library.',\n",
        "   u'Tamara Dobson was fabulously stylish, sexy, and intelligent in her role as Cleopatra Jones, the Karate/Kung Fu kicking United States Special Government Agent (\"jurisdiction from Turkey to Watts Tower baby\") who battles Drug Lord Mommy (Shelly Winters).  Cleo ruffles Mommy\\'s feathers by burning her Turkish poppy field that has a street value of $30 million.  Mommy retaliates by getting her bad cop friends to bust the B&S; House which is run by Cleo\\'s boyfriend Rueben (Bernie Casey).  The B&S; House helps local drug addicts kick the habit.  The B&S; House staff have a Black Panther Party mentality.To add action and humor to the movie is Mommy\\'s odd crew of gay beauties that cater to her every whim; clutsy henchmen; Pusher Doodlebug (Antonio Fargas, best known from \"Starsky & Hutch\").  Doodlebug has his own odd crew that includes his high maintenance girlfriend Tiffany (Brenda Sykes, also played in \"Black Gunn\"), Pickle (Teddy Wilson who went on to star on tv shows like \"Good Times\", \"That\\'s My Mama\", and \"Sanford & Son\"), white chauffer/butler Mattingly (real surname).  Don Corneilus (Soul Train) has a cameo as himself.  Ester Rolle (\"Good Times\") has a cameo as the mother of Cleo\\'s two Karate kicking friends, The Johnson Brothers.  This movie has a plethora of actors, both black and white, who went on to have extensive acting careers.The well written story and screenplay is by Max Julien, who is best known for his role as \"The Mack\" and \"Thomasine & Bushrod\".  The soundtrack yielded two hits, one by Joe Simon and the other by Millie Jackson.Dobson portrayed a strong black woman with a positive character.  Outside of driving the James Bond type Corvette complete with phone, personalized plates, government issued weapons concealed in the door and a top that automatically raised (awesome in 1973) to accomodate Dobson\\'s 6 foot, 2 inch height... she displayed motor bike riding skills and a little bi-lingual capabilities that must have been needed for her traveling abroad.The ending scene, the Bon Voyage party for Cleo ends with her white friend Police Captain Lou Crawford (Dan Frazer who has a very extensive acting portfolio with the likes of \"Kojak\", \"Law & Order\", and \"As The World Turns\") saying \"Right On\" while holding up a clinched fist (black power sign) as Cleo drives off into the sunset for her next big assignment.  His actions amaze the other party people and is a priceless ending that should leave a smile on your face to go with this happy ending.The disconsolate news of Tamara Dobson\\'s death in October 2006 smothered the flames of my nostalgic dreams of her reprising the Cleo role for a third time (second time circa 1975, \"Cleopatra Jones and the Casino of Gold\").  All biographical accounts document Tamara Dobson as having studied fashion at the Maryland Institute College of Arts before her professional modeling career.  Her acting career included film appearances in \"Norman... Is That You?\", \"Chained Heat\", \"Come Back, Charleston Blue\", \"Murder at the World Series\", \"Jason of Star Command\", and \"Buck Rogers in the 25th Century\".  Beyonce appears to have paid homage to \"Cleopatra Jones\" when she played Foxxy Cleopatra in the Austin Powers movie.Tamara Dobson\\'s role as Cleo was a hit and this movie is a classic that would add value to any so-called blaxploitation (Soul Cinema) era movie collection.by:Pamela Jarmon Read more \\u203a',\n",
        "   u'Sure it\\'s over the top. Sure Shelley Winters\\' character is absurd. But this one is a lot of fun. In the genre of blaxploitation movies, this movie is closer to \"Shaft\" in quality than it is to \"Foxy Brown\". \"Foxy\", while enjoyable, is a very amateurish production. \"Cleopatra\", on the other hand, is very well done. The car chase rates as one of the best of the era.As for the transfer, it also is very well done. My only complaint about the DVD is the lack of any additional features. In fact, it is so bare that the menu is a generic Warner Bros. logo instead of related to the movie.Regardless, even if you aren\\'t a big fan of the blaxploitation genre, this one is great entertainment....exciting and funny at the same time.',\n",
        "   u\"As bad as a man as Shaft is, he wouldn't play with Cleopatra Jones if he thought for one minute she was on her last nerve, and it was shredding fast.Tamara Dobson portrays a special agent who is busting up a drug pipeline from Turkey to the United States that is operated by Mommy (Shelley Winters). I hope I don't ruin the ending for you, but keep in mind the movie isn't titled, Mommy.I always found the film a parody of James Bond and the other tough white heroes back in the day who would gently set the lady aside before punching out the villains, with the hero capturing her heart in the end. Cleopatra Jones disarms the bad guys with her charm, but is also cooking up some knuckle sandwiches to take them out with when the time is right.Dobson does a great job in a role that may have been nearly impossible to pull off well. Such over-the-top characters have to be difficult to portray - there is a fine line between acting well or making the character the buffoonish Rambo - but Dobson does a great job.The DVD cover is a pretty poor updated version to the original artwork. The movie is from 1973, not 2003 and the artwork should make that point.If you are looking for a movie that packs a punch, run quickly away from the usual suspects and get Cleopatra Jones.\",\n",
        "   u\"CLEOPATRA JONES (Tamara Dobson) is super-bad! She's a government agent out to take down the drug lords! She knows karate! She's handy w/ a machine gun! She drives a smokin' Corvette! She's beautiful AND she knows the clothes that make the pose! CLEO takes on Mommy (Shelley Winters), the queen of the narcotics underworld, as well as her army of thugs! CLEOPATRA JONES is one of the best, most entertaining urban action films I've ever seen! Filled w/ interesting characters (the Doodlebug mob for instance!), and more genuine soul than a revival meeting, CJ is hard to beat!...\"],\n",

        "  u'review_text': [u'When embarking on a new and somewhat mystical adventure with God, like the labyrinth, it\\'s always good to hear the human voice of someone whose walked ahead of you.  This DVD introduces the beginner to a wide variety of experiences that others - from a wide variety of backgrounds - have had. Some you\\'ll relate to more than others, which is the point, I\\'m sure. Since there is no RIGHT way to walk a labyrinth, this clearly reinforces that point. It invites you to lay down heavy expectations and simply discover for yourself the benefits of slowing down, quieting your mind and letting go of \"doing\" so that you can just \"be\" with God. I\\'d recommend this for group discussion or for individuals interested in this ancient form of meditation.',\n",

        "  u'review_text': [u'\"Some people run at the first sight of stormy weather ... But SOME people hold on and work it out together.\"  -- Breakout lyric from the movie\\'s soundtrack.This movie has absolutely everything.It\\'s got comedy of all sorts, yet this movie really isn\\'t a comedy.And it\\'s got compelling moments that\\'ll make you think and make you feel some kinda way about given relatable characters and life circumstances, yet I wouldn\\'t exactly fit this movie into a mold of your typical drama.\"The Five Heartbeats\" is the loosely autobiographical tale of the rise, fall and ultimately triumph in life of a hit five-man R&B; group from the 1960s (my father and uncles have an ongoing debate about whether this group\\'s experiences were based upon The Temptations, The Four Tops or The Dells).This movie seems like a real-enough, real life story about how money, fame and stardom can breed distrust, hate, disloyalty and an assortment of shady dealings that could undue any family relationship or close friendship.The story follows five young men who start out as close friends who share a common passion and talent: singing.Of course, they get \"discovered\" but as they start to and eventually make it big, they discover their moment at the top is filled with tragedy, anger, addictions and deceptions of all kinds -- realities totally different from the starry-eyed images they\\'d had of \"making it big\" once upon a time.Overall, this movie is very much uplifting because, while it takes a life time, these five friends eventually overcome the past and learn some invaluable life lessons.This is a movie for families -- the plot and various scenes will be interpreted differently by kids and adults, however, both demographics will be able to relate to this movie\\'s overall theme and message.Fame and fortune are fleeting.  Friendships -- good friendships -- are priceless.This is a movie that was out and out ignored by Hollwyood.Easily Robert Townsend\\'s best film and deserving of Academy Award consideration.Awesome acting, brilliant writing and a blazingly inspiring soundtrack.This movie is the complete package.Perhaps the most recommended movie pitch I\\'ll ever make on Amazon for one film!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Guaranteed crowd-pleasing movie and one you can watch over and over and over, and not get tired of.

        "   u\"This is one of my all time favorite movies. It reveals the real life joys, struggles, and sorrows experienced by black music artists of the 60's era. This movie is a treat and monument to American music. It can be enjoyed by  people of all backgrounds and nationalities. The Five Heartbeats tapped  into my emotional highway. This movie is a classic. I only wish this movie  would have recieved the publicity it deserved while it was playing at a  theatre near you. Thank you Mr. Robert Townsend for a job well done!\",\n",
        "   u'Why?  Because if you\\'re here, you probably already saw the movie and are just curious about this release version.  So I\\'ll tell you about it.First, the good:- Comes with the official movie soundtrack.  I mean the FULL soundtrack, it\\'s a separate disc.- Video transfer is done a lot better than the original DVD release.- Case is designed a lot more appealing than the standard black and blue.- Audio is better encoded and easier to hear at lower volumes.- Lots of extras, including some fluff, but hey.- Better aspect ratio, as the picture fills widescreen displays more evenly without stretching.Now, the bad:- The soundtrack...it\\'s so irritating to listen to, because they managed to do the true movie version of \"Nothing But Love\" and some other songs, fresh from the movie, but yet \"Nights Like This\" is that After 7 version.  I don\\'t mind the After 7 version, it\\'s not bad, but I wanted to hear the movie version.  This is especially troublesome when they even managed to do that Byrd song fresh from the movie.- Some of the footage that never made it in the movie SHOULD have.  Like the scene where Duck is explaining that all of the members can sing all different levels.  It would explain a later scene when Choirboy offers to sing in Eddie\\'s place - when I watched the first version I was confused.  A soprano singing a baritone\\'s parts?  Also, there were some slight comedy pieces in there that should have been included.- Some of the extras are just flat out pointless - or if they wanted to include them at least include the characters people cared about.  There\\'s one extra where the actors in kayfabe are giving their thoughts before accepting \\'awards\\'.  Totally corny, but it might have been entertaining if Eddie Kang Jr. and JT were there.  There\\'s only 3 of the five present.- General movie negative...they never did explain what happened to Bobby, from the beginning of the movie.  I was hoping for a deleted scene that would explain this, but alas...So, would I recommend getting this?  Absolutely, because I can almost guarantee it won\\'t be released on HD-DVD or Bluray.

        "   u\"This is one of my FAVORITE movies of all time! I purchased this DVD because I only had the VHS version...and who plays VHS's anymore? Anyway, can you imagine my disappointment when I popped in this 15th anniversary edition and some of the most important scenes were cut out of the movie? It was like watching a shadow of the original. I will be re-purchasing The Five Heartbeats DVD...and this time, I'll make sure it's the regular DVD, not the chopped up anniversary edition. It cuts the heart out of a GREAT movie.\",\n",
        "   u'\"The Five Heartbeats\", one of my favorite films by Robert Townsend, is a wonderful movie about a fictional singing quintet\\'s rise to fame in the 1960s. It somewhat echoes the story of the Temptations, but in actuality, it could have been a profile of just about any black male singing group of that era (it was supposedly based on the story of The Dells).Reportedly, back in 1991, Robert Townsend said that the script, co-written by himself and Keenen Ivory Wayans, wasn\\'t about any one group in particular, but the trials and tribulations of various black vocal groups of the 1960s. Watching this movie made me think of actual situations that happened to different soul music acts in those days, and even as recent as New Edition, Jodeci and Boyz II Men, so Townsend accomplished his goal successfully. The struggles to get to the top, what happens when you get there, the bonds of friendship, egos, trying to keep up with musical trends and of course, the racism, backstabbing, drug abuse and shady characters -- it\\'s all included here as a very real look into just how ruthless and unforgiving the recording industry can be. \"The Five Heartbeats\" even touches upon how black music was ripped off by greedy industry executives and given to white acts to cover, therefore, \"whitewashing\" it for acceptance by white radio listeners and record buyers. This is a movie that weaves comedy, drama, romance, and music together into a singular treat for the eyes and ears.I have a couple of beefs, though: Why are we hearing Delfonics hits from 1969 and 1970 in scenes that are supposed to be taking place in 1965?! Plus the use of synthesizers weren\\'t really in vogue outside of the studio in 1972, yet you see Robert Townsend\\'s character using one on stage in a scene that is supposed to be happening in that year. Someone should have done more musical research! Also, Robert does a wonderful job directing this film, but he leaves much to be desired as an actor. But those things can be overlooked in light of everything else about this movie.With strong performances from Michael Wright (who is truly exceptional as the troubled lead singer Eddie King, Jr. and the REAL star of this movie), Leon, and Hawthorne James as the villainous Big Red, this film deserves your attention and that of anyone who is a fan of classic soul, the Motown sound, and music PERIOD! Also included in the cast are a couple of Hollywood legends - the beautiful and classy Diahann Carroll and tap dancer extraordinaire Harold Nicholas. I highly recommend this...great acting and great musical scenes add up to a GREAT FILM. Get it today! Read more \\u203a'],\n",

        "  u'review_text': [u'Essex Boys is a 1999 \"gangster\" film that takes the viewer into the gritty, dangerous domain of Essex\\'s drug-dealing underworld.  The story is narrated in part by a lad named Billy, a lowly (but fairly quick-witted) driver for the self-important kingpins, and though we don\\'t see everything from Billy\\'s vantage point, it is an effective and engaging means of presenting the story.  Though the characters and the story are pure fiction, the inspiration for the film came from the murder of three suspected drug dealers whose bodies were found in a Range Rover in Essex in 1995.  The story created around this real-life event is highly imaginative, plausible, gripping, and suspenseful.Sean Bean (Sharpe, Extremely Dangerous, Bravo Two Zero, The Fifteen Streets, Golden Eye), donning a cockney-flavoured Essex accent, is simply superb as the jealous, arrogant, mean-spirited, foul-mouthed Jason Locke, a drug-dealing thug who\\'s just been released from prison (and who thinks he\\'s God\\'s gift to women).  He\\'s one of those chaps, the girth of whose vocabulary is such that he\\'d easily be rendered speechless were he required to utter so much as one sentence without lacing it liberally with the \"F\" word.  There is not much at all to like about Locke.  He treats women like dirt and has little more respect for his colleagues. Those used to seeing Bean as an action hero will no doubt enjoy (if that is the right word!) seeing him in such a nasty role.  He is known for really internalizing his roles and becoming the character he\\'s portraying; indeed, it\\'s almost disturbing to see him here, for he simply exudes foulness.The film co-stars Alex Kingston (Moll Flanders) as Locke\\'s feisty, shrewd, ambitious wife, Lisa.  Kingston is a very capable actress who is well-paired with Bean in this film.  Another familiar face is Tom Wilkinson (The Full Monty), who is wonderful as drug middle-man John Dyke. This is a gritty, violent film that doesn\\'t hold back any punches in its depiction of the drug underworld.  It\\'s a good story with a very satisfying ending.  It\\'s a first-rate production and is consumately acted by all involved.  Recommended to fans of the \"gangster\" film genre and to fans of Sean Bean. Read more \\u203a',\n",
        "   u\"After the flash and fire of Lock, Stock..., there were a whole spate of Brit crime flicks (including its empty-headed sequel Snatch).  It's a credit to the genre (or sub-genre) that Essex Boys is one of the better entries.That can be attributed to a very intelligent script, terrific acting (since when have British actors failed to deliver the goods?), and fast-paced directing--all of which speak of a keen understanding of exactly how to craft a thriller that moves the way it should.Sean Bean is outstanding here as Jason, an ugly-minded thug who's just been let out of the pen.  He finds his old mates, after settling a score in an especially violent scene, and together they set about raking in the pounds, primarily from drug dealing.  What they don't count on is Jason's wife Lisa who's the toughest and smartest of all.  Her plots and counterplots land her squarely in the femme fatale arena and it's a lot of fun to watch Alex Kingston, the actress who portrays her, strut her stuff.Also on hand are Billy Wiz, the naive driver who's conscripted into service for Jason, Lisa, and Billy's ex-mentor Mr. D., in an especially riveting performance by Tom Wilkinson, who did a great job in the film In the Bedroom.The ending is very far off from what anyone would expect; the plotting here shows off, as mentioned, just how smart the filmmakers--writer and director both--really are.  A great addition to your crime flick set of films, Essex Boys bites, punches, stings, and packs a wallop.  Grab it.\",\n",
        "   u\"I don't feel the need to spell out the plot of the film, since you probably already know it if you're reading this, so I'll keep this short. If you're American and not used to watching British films you may have to watch it a couple times or try it with subtitles to catch everything, but the movie itself is still wonderful. Sean Bean is (as usual) the bad guy, and he plays it beautifully. If you're a fan of his or just into action-packed gangster flicks, I highly recommend Essex Boys.\",\n",
        "   u\"Watching this movie, it's hard to remember that Sean Bean is an actor and not a vicious criminal.  This is an extremely uncomfortable movie to see, but it's awesome.\",\n",
        "   u'There is nothing attractive about a life of crime as portrayed in this film, and that is one of its strongest suites.  Based on actual events, it\\'s a study of criminal existence at its most bleak---and hats off to the filmmakers and the cast for the pristine starkness of it all.  There\\'s certainly nothing romantic or cool about these people who respect no one and nothing.I viewed it because I like the actors and was curious to see what they\\'d do with material like this.  Sean Bean has villainy down to a fine art---but note that his villains aren\\'t charming or any kind of ad for youth to plug into.  We don\\'t want to identify with his bad guys, we just want them to get their just deserts.  (Bean is all the more a treat when he has an heroic role to sink his teeth into like Sharpe, Neil Byrne, or Boromir---even his heroes are flawed, which says something about the roles he chooses---but he is always intriguingly watchable.)  Alex Kingston, Tom Wilkinson, and Charlie Creed-Meyers are all uncomfortably fine in their respective roles of abused wife, partner in crime, and hapless wheel-man.Others have termed this drama \"gritty\" and that is is, but I think it goes even farther---it is a cautionary tale.'],\n",

        "  u'review_text': [u\"This video is a masterpiece.  I love Hemingway and here the man is captured in all his in your face-tortured-life loving-woman loving glory.  The language in this video is hardly disturbing which makes me think the person who wrote a review for this video claiming it was full of curse words did not actually see it.  If anything this video will instill in the viewer a need to read more about the man and his work.  A rare video.  I've seen it a half dozen times and it never loses it hold on me.  For any Hemingway fan this is a must.\",\n",
        "   u\"A worthwhile and well constructed precise of Hemingway's life, most valuable for its  insights from Hemingway's sons and archival moving film footage, including some sound bites of Hemingway speaking. The video relies (necessarily) on a fair amount of still photography, much of which will be familar to Hemingway aficionados, nevertheless, the presentation is compelling.\",\n",
        "   u\"The review belows states that this video is full of cuss words.  Unless you're a nun, I don't see why you didn't show 14 year old students this video.  I think they can handle words like ''damn''  and ''hell''.This video is great.  It captures the spirit of Hemmingway perfectly;  a boy trying to find his masculinity.  Perfect for teenage boys, to help them avoid mistakes Hemmingway may have made and realize who they are.\",\n",
        "   u'As a new teacher looking for material to accompany my lessons, I bought this to show to my 11th grade American Lit students. I ended up returning it only because after renting it from the library, I decided I preferred to own the more recent documentary on Hemingway\\'s life, \"Rivers to the Stream.\"\"Wrestling with Life\" is narrated by a very stiff and serious Mariel who looks like she\\'s about 18. It also goes a bit too extensively into his childhood and his antipathy towards his mother. But keep in mind I bought this to view with my 11th graders so I was also watching it through their highly crticial and easily distractable eyes. Had it been the only one available, it would have done the job. But the newer DVD is much richer in my opinion. (I found the negative reviews of \"Rivers to the Stream\" completely unfounded;I had no problem with female narration of his short stories.)',\n",
        "   u'Produced in 1998 for A&E;\\'s \"Biography\" series, \"Ernest Hemingway: Wrestling With Life\" is simply the best documentary ever produced on the Nobel and Pulitzer Prize-winning author.  This 90-minute documentary is narrated by Hemingway\\'s grand daughter, actress Mariel Hemingway, and features insightful comments from Ernest\\'s sons Jack and Gregory.  \"Papa Hemingway\" author A.E. Hotchner and publisher Charles Scribner III also provide illuminating commentary. The documentary takes us from Hemingway\\'s childhood in Oak Park, Illinois to his final, tragic days in Ketchum, Idaho, detailing the triumphs and tragedies of the legendary author\\'s life.  \"Papa\" is not always presented in a flattering light, as Hemingway\\'s infidelities, personality flaws, and struggles with alcohol and depression are all discussed unflinchingly.  Actor Scott Glenn reads from Hemingway\\'s works and letters, and most surprising for a documentary of this nature is composer Frank Becker\\'s memorable and evocative music score for this fine production.\"Ernest Hemingway: Wrestling With Life\" is a triumph and a must-see for those who love this author\\'s work;  his life was just as fascinating.'],\n",

        "  u'review_text': [u'This review refers to the Artisan Special Edition(2disc)DVD of \"The Doors\".....Become immersed in the wild ride that Oliver Stone takes you on in this legendary film of a legendary rocker.The extrordinary  life story of Jim Morrison, played eeriley by Val Kilmer, will keep you mesmerized and stay with you long after the movie has ended.The film explores \"The Doors\", from their beginnings in Venice Beach, California, where they exploded onto the rock scene,breaking the mold of music in the 60\\'s, to their rise as superstars. Morrison\\'s life is the main focus as a senstive poet type dropping out of film school, to becoming the Peyote addicted,culture shocking, philosphical rock idol.The LSD trips, the visions of this genius, his personal life and of course the famous controversial concerts are all told through Stone\\'s unique cinematic magic.You\\'ll get lost not only in the time setting of the story but of course in the music as well. \"The Doors\" electrifying music is heard throughout the film and follows them chronologically on their journey. It\\'s a film for fans of the cinema and music alike.As mentioned above Val Kilmer is uncanny in not only his performance as Morrison, but seems to take on the physical appearance as well. The band members played by Kevin Dillon, Kyle Maclachlan and Frank Whaley are extraordinary in their portrayals. Meg Ryan, in a very dramatic roll as Jim\\'s girl Pam is brilliant.This \"Special Edition\" DVD is the one to have(and it\\'s not as expensive as the other) It\\'s a 2 disc set, with a fabulous widescreen picture, and a 5.1 Dolby Dig(get to this through the special feature selections) audio track that will blow you away. Lots and lots of special features. On the disc with the movie you can listen to Stone\\'s commentary where he fills you in on how the band met, the genesis of the songs, and where he has taken license with the story. The second disc is filled with featurettes and production notes. Looking at the Technical info for the other edition (\"The Collectors\") it seems to be longer by 30 minutes and may have some extras not included with this one, but it is not in the 5.1 which for me was the deciding factor in this film featuring this exciting soundtrack.So get out those mood rings and leather fringe vests and get ready to rock with \"The Doors\".....\"This Is The End\"...........Lauriealso recommended:The Very Best of the Doors Read more \\u203a',\n",
        "   u'\"Pam joined him three years later . . .\" is on my copy of the 15 Year Anniversary Edition; the movie is the same as the Special Edition.The packaging and menus are updated and look great. Substantially better than the special edition.On to the 2 new features.The Doors in L.A. - 20 minute feature; Robbie Krieger, John Densmore, (yaaay!), Jimmy Greenspoon, and Pamela Des Barres are the prominent interviews on camera here. Nothing earth shattering, but it\\'s nice to see/hear John Densmore\\'s abridged opinions.The Jim Morrison Phenomena in Paris - it\\'s interesting. You\\'ve got a handful of people who met JDM in Paris and hung out; they describe his mood and what he was (arguably) saying at the time. There\\'s a French librarian who breaks down a lot of the parallels in the subtleties of the lyrics w/Greek literature. There\\'s a somewhat annoying 20 something saying Jim was done with music and The Doors and blah, blah, blah that isn\\'t substantiated w/anything. There is an interview w/Michelle Rudler, who is listed as \"Coroner\" who says lots of things were done wrong in the documentation of Morrison\\'s death. It\\'s about 50 minutes.All of the extras on the Special Edition are here as well.So in conclusion, if you are looking to purchase The Doors movie on DVD, by Oliver Stone, this is the one to get. The movie is entertaining enough but, you know, it\\'s fictional and not historically accurate enough to garner more than 3 stars from this reviewer.',\n",
        "   u\"The Doors suffers the same problems that Stone's other films about real people and events (JFK and Nixon) do; Stone uses the docu-drama format as a license to condense times and events, while simultaneously inventing composite characters and situations that never existed. All too often, these films, while containing exciting filmic and visual elements, ring a bit hollow.The upside of The Doors is the performance of Val Kilmer, who threw himself into the role with ferocity and conviction; that he comes up short in the end isn't due to his acting abilities as much as the choice of episodes and Morrison's characteristics (both real and invented) that Stone chose to film. Simply put, Stone's Morrison comes across as little more than a sporatically gifted poet who sublimates his poetic callings to all the cliched rock star trappings. Perhaps this does describe some of Morrison's personality to a degree, but after seeing Morrison get stoned, drunk and act like a spoiled child throwing a tantrum for 2 hours plus, one wonders if Oliver thought of Morrison as basically an obnoxious drunk (possessed by the soul of a bald, silly-looking, half-naked dead indian that continually wanders around the movie) and, if so, what it was that turned Stone onto making the film in the first place...The downside, in addition to the lack of scope regarding Morrison, comes in the numerous episodes that never happened (The Doors tripping on acid in the desert, Patricia Kennealy being present at the New Haven show Morrison got arrested at, Particia Kennealy and Pam Courson having a catfight, Buick actually making a commercial using the song Light My Fire and Jim finding out about it by watching tv, Jim setting fire to his and Pam's house while Pam was smacked up in the closet...and on and on). Also, the years of 1967 to early 1969 take up about an hour and a half of the movie, while the remainder of 1969 through to mid 1971 take about twenty minutes.It's a shame that Stone went to such trouble to set up and film some great concert sequences, and Kilmer really made a terrific attempt at playing Morrison, but in the end both were content to rest the character on both the various myths about the singer and the confirmed instances of Morrison at his drunken worst. A well-shot film that, in the end, has little to do with reality. Read more \\u203a\"],\n",

        "   u'This material does seem a bit dated, so it\\'s easy to forget that this was a radical idea when it first came out -- learning can be fun!  It still is, thanks to the reissue of the material found on this two-disc set.  Shortly after receiving a complimentary copy, my husband was singing along to old favorites and our toddler was having a grand old time learning the songs.  All original 46 songs from the show are here, as well as the brand new \"I\\'m Gonna Send Your Vote to College\", about the electoral college, and a lost song, \"The Weather Show\".  There are also three songs  with the series\\' only continuing characters, Scooter Computer and Mr. Chips.You can view a full selection list or see items grouped into categories of Grammar Rock, Science Rock, Multiplication Rock, America Rock or Money Rock, and a jukebox capability allows you to make playlists of songs to be played in order or on shuffle.  There\\'s a short trivia game with quizzes and word scrambles, puzzles, four music videos (by the Lemonheads and others) singing SHR songs to the SHR video, a featurette about the show\\'s Emmy wins, a Nike commercial using a SHR song, and fun, interesting commentary by several of the SHR team.  This dvd version is terrific, demonstrating that the Schoolhouse Rock team is still just as dedicated to quality programming and education as it ever was.  The accompanying booklet is packed with color and information -- including the words to eleven songs.  Very nicely done and highly recommended, not only  for nostalgic value, but for its continuing ability to inform and entertain.',\n",
        "   u'Schoolhouse Rock is an unusual American cultural phenomenon. Nearly every person who grew up after the late Sixties is familiar with the series. How ubiquitous is it? I would predict that if you started humming \"Conjunction Junction,\" \"I\\'m Just a Bill,\" or \"Three Is a Magic Number\" in a room of a dozen people, three-quarters would know the reference and at least a couple would probably join in humming or singing the words.This is unimpeachable stuff. To say that this 2-disc set is definitive is to do injustice to the word \"definitive.\" EVERYTHING you would ever want to know about Schoolhouse Rock is here. All forty-six cartoons ever done for the series are included, even the \"Scooter Computer and Mr. Chips\" series that looked at computers. The electoral college toon that was done later is part of this collection, too.The extras on the second disc are outstanding. In addition to Scooter Computer and the rarely seen \"The Weather Show,\" you get a behind the scenes look at the electoral college song, a Top 20 countdown of the best in the series, a puzzle game that features the songs, four music videos of the songs arranged by contemporary pop/rock groups, a feature on the Emmy Awards won by the series, commentary by the creators, and more.The navigation design of the DVD is superb. Only want to see the \"Multiplication Rock\" or \"America Rock\" toons? You can select the specific series you want, play all within a series, or pick each specific toon from a series. You can also choose to play all forty-six toons or just the ones chosen by fans as the top ones. There\\'s a built-in shuffle feature as well. Every DVD should be this easy to navigate and use.Even the booklet that comes with this edition is helpful. The lyrics for the top ten toons are included as is the history of Schoolhouse Rock. A chapter breakdown is included at the end of the booklet.Schoolhouse Rock is virtually impervious to review due to its unbiquitous nature within a whole generation or two of Americans. The cleverness of the animation enlivens the topic discussed, not to mention holding the attention of young children. The songs are exceptionally catchy; I\\'m still amazed at how they managed to do such a great job marrying the Preamble of the Constitution with a hummable melody. Definitely a reflection of the musical styles of the day, songs like \"Verb: That\\'s What\\'s Happening\" (done in the style of the soundtrack of \"Shaft\") or \"The Preamble\" (70s Folk/Rock) capture the era perfectly. It makes those of us who grew up in those days misty-eyed for a return of that AM radio sound to today\\'s music.If you have kids (or are just nostalgic at heart), this DVD is essential. I\\'m using it as homeschool material for our kids. When my son sings the songs, it\\'s great to know another generation will appreciate the merits of Schoolhouse Rock. No question, this 30th anniversary edition of Schoolhouse Rock is truly worthy of five stars. Read more \\u203a',\n",
        "   u'After hearing my preschooler memorize and recite pointless nursery rhymes, I decided to put her brain to better use. Enter \"Schoolhouse Rock.\"  Now, instead of hearing about four-and-twenty blackbirds baked in a pie, I\\'m hearing \"12x8 is the same as 10x8 plus 2x8... 80 plus 16 is 96.\" Yes, really. Her grandmother was equally impressed when asked \"What\\'s a conjunction?\"Schoolhouse Rock presents Multiplication, Grammar, American History, and Science and Computers in all it\\'s emmy-winning glory. The music -- rock, jazz, bluegrass and country -- are masterfully produced and yes, danceable.  The cartoons are hip, funny, well-crafted and support the curriculum well. It\\'s education with attitude.Here\\'s the best part: it is fun! Give your children the remote and let them repeat their favorites over and over again.  Before you know it, they\\'ll have a brain packed full of good stuff. I can\\'t tell you how many grammar quizzes I passed by remembering the lyrics \"Lolly Lolly Lolly get your adverbs here,\" \"then I unpacked my adjectives,\" and \"a noun is a person place or thing.\" Many of my friends hummed the tune of \"the preamble\" to the constitution during history exams. There is only one drawback -- some of the songs use improper English like \"ain\\'t.\" There is a jukebox feature on each component which allows you to select which tracks to play, so you can omit those if you like.I\\'d also recommend the CD Box Set or the individual CDs to reinforce the material, but not in place of the DVD.'],\n",

        "  u'review_text': [u\"At long last the Discworld comes to the small screen; in this the first North American release of the Brit TV series. All the humour and brilliant  dialogue of the novel translated very well to this visual medium. Character  visuals while not always quite as I imagined, still carried off the right  impression. Voice casting is superb and included both Christopher Lee (as  Death, of course!) and Jane Horrocks. I can't wait until Reaper Man and  Soul Music are released to hear Chris Lee in a featured role.No the  animation is not state of the art, but still manages to exceed the basic  needs of the story. This isn't about slick animation, but superb dialogue  and inventive storytelling. It is about time that we got to see these  brilliant stories and imaginatively crafted characters realized on  screen.Buy this video and show your support of the Discworld series. If  sales on this are good, we'll likely see more released in the near future.\",\n",
        "   u\"I have seen many books that were turned into movies and shows, both live action and animated. 90% of the time it is a complete let down.  So I was highly skeptical of Wyrd Sisters.  I am a devoted fan of the Discworld  series and despite living in the United States I have been able to obtain  just about everything printed about the Discworld.  I got this video and  expected the usual terrible adaptation where the animation is cheap and all  wrong for what I pictured and the story is changed horribly because the  movie producers think we are so stupid we will only get a joke or a plot  line if its yelled in our faces. But I was delighted with these videos.  They are probably the best adaptation of a novel I have ever seen. The  movie was well animated, I think, probably because it was not made in the  USA! But animation aside, the story itself was a brilliant adaptation of  the book, and a lot the humor is very subtle and you can miss it if you  aren't careful. And I loved the British accents, because I tend to not  think of the books that way when I am reading them. This video had me  laughing so hard at points my stomach hurt, and I will be watching again  and again to catch what I missed from laughing, if I can contain myself  that is.So in summary all I can say is get it if you like the Discworld  novels, get this video because you won't be disappointed!\",\n",
        "   u\"I've been putting off buying the Pratchett cartoons, since I was apprehensive that the images wouldn't match my own personal images of the characters.I was also worried that the process of transferring print to screen would lose a lot of the subtlety of the original.I needn't have worried.Very enjoyable indeed.Were the characters as I imagined them? Not all, No. Did it matter? Not really.I found to my delight that the makers of the cartoon had taken the trouble to immerse themselves in the books, and hence were able to throw in the occasional allusion (for the diehard fans) and to edit the narrative without any loss of enjoyment.Strongly recommended.Soul Music is even better.\",\n",
        "   u\"I've loved Terry Pratchett's Discworld from the first words of The Colour of Magic and his delightful description of the luggage.  I will admit that the voice they gave Magrat is grating on the nerves and the animation could have been a bit better.  Honestly, I think the only three characters they got right on were Granny Weatherwax, Death and Verence (the fool).But to see the book brought so wonderfully to life, so many little things they retained, and they didn't cheat on the spell!  I adore it.  This may not be for the 'perfectionists who think they are Number One Pratchett Fans', but for the rest of us poor mortals, it's absolutely endearing.\",\n",
        "   u\"I got this DVD because, like many, I'm a Terry Pratchett junky. At first glance I had some problems mostly do to the very made-for-tv animation and more important, many of my ideas of what the characters were like was just as idiosyncratic and those of everyone else. I stuck with it, and in short order discovered I liked this series very much - in an endearing sort of way.Granny Weatherwax, Nanny Ogg, and Magrat are nearly perfect. Especially the latter two, Nanny Ogg displaying her usual 'loosidity' and Magrat as the permanently flower-child witch. Having been roped into responsibility of the murdered king's infant son, the maneuvers, manipulations, and frontal attacks of three ladies who obey the rules only when it is convenient can't help by claim the loyalty of those of use who also believe in doing the right thing even when we have to do the wrong thing in order to accomplish it. A surprising amount of Pratchett's tongue-in-cheek sarcasm makes it through the transition from book to tube as well.The usurpers to the Lancre throne are the enemy. Not satisfied with the country they proceed to cut down all the trees, burn the houses of non-taxpayers, and drive the witches from the kingdom. When all of this lands in the witches' laps along with the child and the ghost of its father. They pack young Tom-John off with a band of wandering players and are finally driven by a kidnapped cat to make a direct confrontation, which culminates in a war of headology and a final confrontation of Macbethian proportions. And, in the background, a fool makes a man of himself over Margrat.I found DEATH was the least convincing character. He had all the lines right, but I had expected something more sepulchral - especially from Christopher Lee. After all, if someone goes about speaking in capital letters all the time one expects drum rolls or killer shark themes to play when you actually hear him. Well, he was OK, but not DEATH as I would live him.Poor animation and an insufficiently dead DEATH aside, all this really is good fun. The DVD does demonstrate that Pratchett's appeal is much wider than I would have previously guessed. I may even start giving copies of the book away as Christmas presents. Read more \\u203a\"],\n",

        "  u'review_text': [u\"These two videos put together will definitely give you a good total body toning workout.  I really like Firm Abs and Arms, not just because it's a great workout for your arms, but because Karen Voight really goes into detail in explaining proper form for ab exercises.  And Lean Legs and Buns, although not technically an aerobic workout, will still get your heart rate up there, just from all those squats, lunges, etc.  The only problem I had with these videos is that I wasn't aware that you need to use a step or platform with them.  You can get away with doing the arm and ab work on the floor, although it will not give you the same range of motion as on the step.  But for the Leg and Buns video, a step or platform is definitely needed.  Definitely buy these videos, but make sure you have some kind of stable platform to step on!\",\n",
        "   u\"This is a fantastic tape. This workout really works your entire upper body. My back, arms and abls are all visibly tighter, and my posture has greatly improved. I'm very glad I found this tape. I have never gotten any results with my arms before. Ms. Voight takes each exercise slowly, so you get the full benefit of each movement. I've used tapes where they do everything too quickly for it to do any good.By the way, you don't need a step if you can improvise with your equipment a little. I chose to buy an incline board instead and my workout room has a step.\",\n",
        "   u'I loved this video.  It was a little rough at first but after we got into shape it was wonderful.  We did this video in a rotation with aerobics and did it every other day and we saw results within 4 weeks.',\n",
        "   u'After reading all the other reviews, I bought this workout and they all proved to be true!!  This is such an excellent ARMS and ABS workout!!  Karen is a great instructor and she works your ARMS AND ABS until fatigued!!  You will feel it the next day with eveything you do!!  I am already seeing visible results and I have only done this workout 4 times.  If you want to reshape your upper body, this is the best investment for it!!!',\n",
        "   u\"One of the best things about this video is that Ms. Voight knows how to get you to use correct form so that you don't hurt your back and so that you get the most out of the workout. After only a couple of weeks I could  feel that the ab work was paying off. After two months of doing this tape  three times a week, I'm starting to see some muscle definition, my posture  is greatly improved, and I'm now using heavier weights. Be patient, stay  with it, eat a sensible diet, combine it with an aerobic workout, and  you'll definitely see results.\",\n",
        "   u\"Karen Voight explains the technique superbly and is one of the few instructors to actually demonstrate how to protect your back while doing sit-ups - many other videos mention this but I never understood what they meant until I saw Karen's excellent demonstration.Her professional style is a refreshing break from the chirpy cheerleader types that normally make these videos.\",\n",
        "   u\"I like this workout because all the moves are very slow and deliberate and Karen's instructions on maintaining correct form is very good. You will  need a step box that can provide an inclined platform and some dumbells.\"],\n",

        "  u'review_text': [u\"This is one of the best stretching videos out there, it is very calming and will stretch you from head to toe.This is one of Karen's earlier videos from 1991, you will see a much more serious Karen than in her more recent videos. I don't think she smiles once in the video, but for me it doesn't take away from a great stretching routine. The entire routine is 40 minutes, starting out with a 10 minute standing routine, then 30 minutes of floor stretching. All the stretches are held for 20-30 seconds, and Karen offers a lot of details and helpful tips for each stretch and also giving options to for deeper stretches. A towel is used to aid stretching for those less flexible. Karen has 3 exercisers with her, one of them is a man who is good towatch for those with limited flexibility. Those looking for yoga should look elsewhere as this is athletic type stretching. But if you are looking for a relaxing stretch video, this is a good one. The music is new agey/jazz type music which suits the atmosphere well.The DVD also offers some of Karen's walking tips, you will see a more recent Karen in this segment. There are also clips of some of her other videos featured as well.\",\n",
        "   u\"The biggest problem I always had with all the stretch tapes I tried before is that none of them let you stretch long enough to get real benefit of stretching. Everbody seemed so busy to move onto the next position. It sometimes made me even wonder if those advanced exercisers really could stretch muscles in 3 seconds. But I COULD stretch and feel it with this tape. Every stretch is about 20-30 seconds long and this makes you feel really refreshed after done as well as you can learn which part of your body is better or worse. The other thing I love about this tape is that it is very easy to do. Karen doesn't frustrate me with unattainable range of motion or positions. Her cueing is excellent, her comments on how you should visualize or feel when doing certain stretches are very very helpful. I hope she will make another tape like this soon.\",\n",
        "   u\"This is the transferred-to-DVD version of Karen's classic Pure and Simple Stretch video and it shows in the less-than-smooth transitions between the stretching chapters.  The costumes and hairstyles are dated, so if that sort of thing bothers you, stay away.  Karen's pinky-lavender and bright blue ensemble is a good reminder of why the 80s haven't come back--yet.  The cover design is the same as it always was.There are two stretching sections, one standing (10 minutes) and one on the floor (30 minutes).  You can do them in one continuous 40 minute program or do them separately.  The stretches flow smoothly from one to the next and are held a good, long time, much longer than in most stretching videos.  Karen's very serious demeanor isn't everyone's cup of tea, but her cueing is excellent; after you've done the routine once or twice, you can do it without watching, just listening, and she gives tips for proper form right at the places where you need them.  All you need to do the stretches is a mat (if you want one), and one or two folded towels for the floor stretches.There are two women and a man doing the stretches with her. Karen gives different levels of some of the stretches, encouraging you to do what is comfortable for you and stop when something pulls or hurts.  Unlike in many videos/DVDs, the others are not demonstrating the different levels of stretching, with one doing beginner and one intermediate and so on; all three just stretch along with her, doing what seems comfortable for them.  There is NO chit chat at all on this DVD; Karen is all business and the others never open their mouths.The music is New Age (if you like New Age, you will recongize some of the names)and is relaxing and unobtrusive; the set is plain.  There are some extras on the DVD that are not on the video, but they aren't anything to write home about.  The walking tips are nice but nothing special and the rest are just ads for Karen's other products.If you like yoga-style stretching, this will probably not be the DVD for you.  This is an athletic-style stretch.  But if you want a good, sound stretching video that will leave you feeling relaxed and energized at the same time, then this is a great choice.  There's a reason that the video is considered a classic and I highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in a solid stretching program. Read more \\u203a\",\n",
        "   u'Have been looking for videos on stretching. When I found this one I gave it a chance. Found it very relaxing. Helped me realize just how stiff I had become. Have been going to doctors about pain in my back and feet.  The  pain I was experiencing was from some form of numbness.  This video has a  shown me that my problem lied in how stiff I had become from sitting in a  chair all day at work and then at home. The only draw back is that there is  not a more advanced tape once I have mastered this one, and I do want to  progress.  39 year old male.',\n",
        "   u'I am overweight, middle-aged, and out of shape. I was seriously injured in an automobile accident.  After ten years of little improvement from standard therapies, I started doing this tape.  Results were very quick.  After two or three years, I have noticed considerable improvements in all  sorts of areas, not just the back/neck problems I started using it for.  My  balance has improved, and twisted ankles are a thing of the past.  This  tape is the best I have found of any kind, any where.  Soothing music, good  timing, good instruction, high production values -- Karen Voight has my  heartfelt thanks.',\n",
        "   u\"I am a 55 year old female with osteoarthritis. I use this tape after I've completed my aerobic workout when my body temperature is up.  Karen starts with 5 minutes of standing dynamic stretches and then the remainder of the tape consists of 20-30 second static stretches on the floor. The neck stretches are exceptionally thorough and have relieved the stiffness in that area of my body. The music is soothing as is Karen's voice; my only complaint is that she doesn't smile during the entire video.  I use the video 3 times a week and am experiencing much more flexability.  I highly recommend it.\"],\n",

        "  u'review_text': [u'Energy Sprint is an advanced workout for those starting to exercise and an invigorating challenge for those who have already achieved a high level of fitness. Spending 80 minutes on exercise requires determination, stamina and dedication!You can either use a step/bench or work your way up to using it. The step Karen sells is great as you can use it at different height levels to increase the intensity of the exercises. This workout is a bit different than normal step workouts. You will notice a \"Sprint Timer\" which will appear when the intensity level goes up. The timer helps to keep you going right to the last second even though the exercises are very challenging at that point.Energy Sprint is based on \"Interval Training.\" You will alternate between high and low levels of intensity. Karen is known for her innovative workout programs and this in a good example of how she uses full range of motion, control of movement and repetitions which ensure you will change your shape and reach your goals.Karen owns the Voight Fitness and Dance Center in Los Angeles, CA where she keeps her clients in top shape. She excels in clarity of instruction and creative style of motion. She incorporates some of her classic \"Karen Moves\" into this video and also focuses on many unique step moves you won\\'t see anywhere else.Have your step all ready to go when you put in this video. Karen jumps right into the first 40 minute aerobic section, keeps you moving through 15 minutes of butt and leg exercises, helps you shape your arms and upper body for 15 minutes and then spends 12 minutes showing you how to get those abs in shape.There is a heart rate check during this workout, but you will want to monitor your heart rate during the aerobics section as some of the exercises are pretty intense. Don\\'t let that stop you from ordering this video. While it is the hardest video I have ever done in my life, I feel incredibly good after I get through it. I can tell a difference in my circulation, my body is warm for hours and I feel very alert and ready to face life\\'s next challenge. If you are serious about fitness, this is the workout you will want add to your workout video collection.~The Rebecca Review Read more \\u203a',\n",
        "   u'This is a step interval tape but it goes beyond just that description. She  is a terrific teacher, reminding you constantly of proper form and  variations for different fitness levels. She does leg toning before the  cardio to really wear your legs out and has a great upper body and abs  section at the end. The warm up is thorough, the cool down is great, too  and by the end your entire body, top to bottom, has been worked evenly. You  will get cardiovascular benefits, strength training and toning out of this  one amazing tape. Even if it is hard to find or takes a while to order, it  is SOOOOO worth the wait. This is the only tape in my collection of over 40  exercise tapes that I can honestly say will do it all. For beginner\\'s, it\\'s  a tough time at first, but use the modifications she suggests and you will  progress like a pro. This is also the kind of workout that is equally  applicable to men and women, as the movements are athletic, not  \"dancy\" and her approach is very no-nonsense and technical, not  the usual \"cheerleader\" instructor. Any fitness enthusiasts or  anyone looking for help in getting fit should have this tape, male or  female.  END',\n",
        "   u'-\"Energy Sprint\" works your heart and all your muscles with an interesting, challenging step-interval aerobics and muscle-toning routine.  You need a step and a set of fairly light hand weights.  It is appropriate for all levels of exerciser except perhaps true beginners who are very obese.  Most beginners would enjoy this tape and get a lot of benefit from it.-This 80-minute workout starts with a warm-up and lower-body sculpting, using the step.-Then come 7 cardio intervals called \"sprints\" of different lengths (1 1/2, 1 1/2, 3, 3 1/2, 3 1/2, 4, 5 1/2 minutes).  All the intervals use the step, except the last, which is very fast and fun, but low-impact and on the floor with triumphant-sounding music.  Between intervals is a little lighter work.-Then comes upper body sculpting for about 10 minutes.  Pushups are a nice easy variation with your ribs on the step -- good for those of us who don\\'t like regular pushups.-Next is a good abdominal section with interesting moves and plenty of variety.-Finally you get a good stretch.-Karen Voight explains the moves like a great teacher, not like a cheerleader, coach, or drill sergeant.  The workout team is nice to look at because they look like regular people.  They are of different ages, races, genders, and fitness levels, but they all do the whole workout and you can see they are really working hard.  That\\'s motivating.  The moves are interesting and varied without being too complicated, and Karen\\'s cueing is very good.-I think most beginners could do this routine.  It might take a few times through to learn the moves, but they are really not very complicated, and you can take breaks and just work your way up gradually to doing the whole workout.  For beginners, this tape could be the only exercise tape you need for quite a while.-For intermediate to advanced exercisers, this tape is still challenging and interesting.  If it gets too easy, just raise your step and/or use heavier weights.',\n",
        "   u'This tape is one of the few aerobic tapes I\\'ve done that is interesting enough to do more than once. One of the few where you will break into a sweat in 20 minutes. Karen\\'s form is excellent, and is for those who really  want the most out of their time spent exercising. She also works with  graceful movement, which is a rare quality in most other \"just keep  running\" type videos. If it\\'s too fast for you to start with, follow  the people in the video who are doing the all-floor version. Excellent  video instruction.'],\n",

        "  u'review_text': [u'-Think you are ready for a tougher toning/sculpting tape? This is it!-You need lighter hand weights than you would normally use, because you will do many repetitions of big, interesting compound movements. You also need ankle weights and a mat. The workout team shows how to use a 3-pound \"body ball\" or weights for some of the exercises. (The ball is NOT necessary).-The first section of the tape is all done standing, and the second section is done on the floor, so you are not constantly lying down and standing up to move from one exercise to the next.-Karen Voight speaks like a really good teacher, not a peppy cheerleader. She explains proper form in great detail and demonstrates common mistakes to avoid, all during the workout so you don\\'t have to stop working to learn the moves.-The only thing I don\\'t like is the music, which is very heavy rock.-The approach of many repetitions of compound movements is a good addition to a varied workout routine. I also have tapes with 12-16 repetitions of isolation exercises and few repetitions of compound moves with heavy weights, so this works your muscles in new ways.',\n",
        "   u\"This is the first video I've purchased utilizing weights and figured I couldn't go wrong with Karen Voight. I own 5 other Karen Voight videos and all are exceptional workouts. You know you've accomplished something when you're done with one of her videos, and this tape is no exception. Its 85 minutes long and quite challenging but you'll see and feel results almost immediately. I've lost quite a few inches in less than a month doing this tape at least three times a week. Bottom line - it works!\",\n",
        "   u'I have been working out to this video for two months now and it still kicks. The video is divided into 3 segments, upper body, lower body and abs. It starts with a very thorough warm up.The upper body with weights is the toughest. The first five minutes or so works the larger muscles and I am able to use seven pound weights, then I have to switch to 2 pound weights, to complete the upper body, there is barely any rest from one exercise to another and often you are working two muscle groups simultaneously while moving your lower body. The moves are easy to follow, but take a lot of willpower to complete the reps. Believe me your muscles will be burning when you finish the upper body part. I really enjoy the lower body, no lunges, squats and all that, you lie down almost the entire time and work the outer and inner thigh, the buttocks and the back and front of thighs. I dont do the ab section too often for some reason it stresses my neck too much, although it is definately a challenge. The entire workout uses weights, you can adjust according to your needs.I sugest you get this tape if you want a really challenging sculpting workout. I have definately developed more upper body shape and strength, I can actually do at least ten full push ups at a time, as a woman these are difficult to do. I have been working out for a while now and so far this is one of the most challenging workouts I have done so far, I am still looking for one to match it. The entire workout is 84 minutes, I have never done the complete tape as yet, but Im working on it.',\n",
        "   u'Warning! This workout is not for the novice exerciser.  I am a big fan of Karen Voight and find her to be one of the finest fitness experts around today.  Her workouts are normally geared toward the immediate to advanced exerciser.  This workout is intense and very, very, very effective! But way tooooooo long, 85 minutes to be exact.  I use this video one to two days a week (depending on my schedule). There is a natural break in between the workout making it possible to divide the workout into two segments. You could do the first part of the workout in the morning and the other part in the evening or can do them on two different days. This is one video tape that does not get rotated out of my workout schedule.  It one of my regulars because it stills challenges me.',\n",
        "   u'I have done The Firm tapes for about 6 months but have found Karen Voight to be more effective.  I like her teaching style.. as one reviewer put it \" not a peppy cheerleader\". I did find that the tape was difficult as a beginner but I am hoping with more use I will be able to master it. In some of the exercises I couldn\\'t believe she was doing them with weights and still talking! There were moments where I had to put the weights down because I simply could not do the exercise with them. Personally, I like the music. It is better than the soft porn type that \"The Firm\" uses!',\n",
        "   u\"I have been working out, by either going to a gym or doing videos at home, for over 20 years (with only a few, unfortunate,slack times thrown in). This tape is the best! It was my first Karen Voight tape and won't be my last... I'm ordering another one when I complete this review.No stranger to weight training, I was truly shocked that I had to use less weight in order to keep up, even to the extent that I remove my ankle weight for the quad work. I love her music choices, since I need a driving beat to keep moving or I get bored. My only complaint is that she didn't dub the vocals out... the singing competes with her voice at times plus, and this is the worst part, the words to the song keep going around and around my head AFTER the tape is off. :-)To all of you who wonder how the guys can be using 10+ lb weights during the arm section, watch very carefully when they drop the weights at the end of the first section... they bounce! I know I felt better seeing that they were just props.\"],\n",

This is one week later, and they are jumping away learning all the tricks on the video. My 9 year old daughter is starting a new \"hip-hop\" trend at school, getting everyone interested in an \"old-fashioned\" play that even the parents can relate to.  Thanks Erin.. my kids now prefers jumping over hanging in the couch with their game-boy!',\n",

        "  u'review_text': [u'When you compare this 1995 video to Karen\\'s newer yoga inspired videos, there is quite a contrast. Karen is still one of the most talented instructors. She adapts her workouts to the changing time and is a leader in the fitness community. What I love most about Karen\\'s workouts is her instructing style. Her voice is calm, the transitions between exercises are smooth, and when she tells you to push your limits, you know you are going to feel the burn. Once you have mastered the classic \"Karen Moves,\" her videos become easier to follow.In this workout, you will notice a techno/gym feel. You will need 2-5lb. hand weights or her unique 12 lb. padded weighted bar. It is worth collecting all of Karen\\'s fitness products as other instructors soon copy her and you won\\'t need to buy extra equipment for those videos. The weighted bar is very sturdy and can be unscrewed in the center so it may be used as a 6-lb. bar. I have found myself using this bar in some of the Method videos.This video is divided into two main sections. The more advanced first 25 minutes warms your muscles and prepares you for the second body sculpting section. On your first viewing, you might have to fast forward through about 5 minutes of various footwork segments or you can adapt your footwork until you learn all the steps. I find this workout would not be suitable for anyone with knee problems, unless they adapted the footwork.If you can make it through the first half (I fake about 10 minutes of footwork - trust me!), then you will enjoy developing long lean muscles, targeting your butt, firming up your abs and working on your inner thighs in the second and best segment of this video. I love the creative use of the weighted bar. Karen has a good imagination and uses props to help you balance and the bar makes you feel like you are working out in a gym.I rate this video advanced because of the fast paced beginning and the heavier weight bar. The floor workout is much slower in pace and concentrated to the upper body. If you focus your mind, clear out all distractions, and remind yourself why you are doing this video, it becomes a little easier.Karen has just released two new videos with some interesting equipment. She has such a range of fitness expertise and is an Internationally acclaimed fitness expert. I can\\'t wait for Amazon to make her new \"Reform\" series available. She also has a new mat and a ring you can use for resistance. Enjoy working out!~The Rebecca Review Read more \\u203a',\n",
        "   u\"I loved this fast paced cardio/strength tape.  Karen's excellent cuing and good choreography will keep you interested and give you a great workout.  The toning is thorough and you will feel energized at the end.  The  soundtrack is very good and as always, the production quality is top notch.\",\n",
        "   u'Paula Abdul looked so fabulous in her \"Get Up and Dance\" video that I scouted out the Internet for information about her \"fitness consultant\" Karen Voight. At the time I was moving quickly back into intermediate/early advanced level exercise thanks to the Abdul tape, and \"S & SM\" seemed like the best introduction I could get to Karen\\'s work. It\\'s great! The staging reminds me of the set for Madonna\\'s \"Express Yourself\" music video--I half-expected to see the Material Girl herself drop by and show off some of HER smooth moves. But the music--jazz laced with funk, and later, some mellow, almost New Age numbers--is like nothing on MTV. This is not disco or pop that will go out of style in a few years--it will still sound fresh ten or twenty years from now! Much has already been written about her gift for teaching, but let me add that Karen cues so well that even when the lighting and the camera play goofy tricks on my eyes, I could still follow the routines without messing up. My only complaint about the production is that during the cool-down the camera operators did at least two gratuitous close-ups of Stacy\\'s and Michelle\\'s faces. Granted, these ladies are attractive, but come on now--this is a serious workout--what was the point of filling the screen with extreme zoom-ins focusing on their closed eyes and finely chiseled noses? It didn\\'t do anything toward helping me learn the routine or get into the spirit of relaxation. Of course, maybe I\\'m not the gender/orientation that would appreciate such artistic camera shots :) But I digress. That is such a trivial matter in the grand scheme of this workout. It was just annoying, that\\'s all. Let\\'s get back to this review: The title begins with the word \"Strong\", which rightfully indicates that the tape\\'s primary emphasis is its muscle conditioning program. However, I agree with Wendy that Karen really does a lot with the non-stop 25 minutes of aerobics. Both the music and the moves flow so smoothly into one another that this routine flies by, and before you know it, Karen is smiling at you and saying, \"we\\'re done.\" Regarding the strengthening section, I must confess I haven\\'t been very faithful about doing it. You\\'re reading a review from someone who hates calisthenics like poison. But other than the first set of exercises for the hips and buttocks, which for some reason I can\\'t do without bothering my lower back, this is the most interesting and even relaxing routine of its type I\\'ve ever tried. And bless her heart--Karen exercises right along with you. She doesn\\'t run around the floor correcting everyone\\'s form or counting repetitions while you lie there flopping like a fish out of water. (I really do need to get motivated to stick with this part of the routine--if anyone out there has seen some real results from doing it, let me hear from you. I think that would do the trick!) The built-in verstility of this tape makes it a winner, too. If you\\'re beginner to intermediate level, you can alternate the two parts of this on a daily basis--aerobics one day, and strength the next. You can also start with lighter weights and work your way up as you get stronger and learn the routine. If you\\'re intermediate-to-advanced, or are trying to lose weight, the entire tape can be done alternating days with a longer (30+ minutes) aerobics routine. Best of all, Karen\\'s style is the greatest for the times when nothing\\'s going right and you\\'re in a bad mood. Most days I\\'m a party animal when it comes to aerobics. I can\\'t wait till it\\'s 9:00pm when my daughter\\'s in bed and my husband\\'s surfing the \"Net\" so I can jam with Paula Abdul or Donna Richardson. But once or twice a month I have a bad night where it\\'s 10:30 and I still haven\\'t exercised. With apologies to Cyndi Lauper, when that happens, this girl just doesn\\'t want to have fun! Those are the nights I pull out this tape and let Karen pull me gently into activity. Her all-business demeanor is just what I need at that point. Even if I only do the aerobics, I\\'m much more refreshed the next day than if I\\'d just blown off exercise and gone straight to bed. Terrific instructor, fabulous music, and a versatile workout that will advance with the exerciser. . .need I say more? Grade: A+ Read more \\u203a',\n",
        "   u\"This is a workout that will definitely raise your energy level. She has a great personality and is very good at giving cues--I found it easy to learn the moves. I have several of her videos and alternate them for variety.  This one doesn't require a step, and it's not the most challenging of her  videos, but you still get a very good workout. Of all her videos that I  have, I like the music on this one the best.\",\n",
        "   u'Simple and low-impact moves that are very effective. Great tempo and music keep you energized that make you want to do more. Dance routines are easy to follow and delivers good cardio workout. Sculpting section is easy,  slow-paced yet effective. Must-have for your workout video library!',\n",
        "   u\"The production values are excellent, and I like Karen's professional demeanor--helpful but not cutesy or chatty. My favorite part of the video is the sculpting with weights section, the second part. It can be adapted  for any level. As for the aerobics section, the choreography is not  difficult, but Karen seems to equate working hard with working fast, and I  don't agree. Still, a nice video.\"],\n",

This is so bad I wanted to return it!NOT WORTH A PENNY and whoever produced this movie in Hollywood should be FIRED!',\n",

Witness line dancing sequences that roll before your eyes for lengthy periods of time, Turner himself hamming it up in front of the camera with stupid human tricks and a severe case of egomania, a werewolf that makes the kiddie masks at your local dime store appear realistic and last but certainly not least a host of actors who couldn't act their way out of a shallow grave. And that is where this pathetic celluloid trash should have gone in the first place... into a shallow grave! Horribly written, ineptly directed I suggest you ignore this lousy excuse for a movie at all costs!\",\n",

Clive Turner (the director) obviously spent a great deal of time planning  this film for the well-rounded movie goer.

The werewolf scenes were so cheap looking, the acting was terrible, and half the movie was about a  bunch of drunk rednecks dancing to country music. They didn\\'t even show the  werewolf till the end; and it was a cheap computer-morph of a girl turning  into one. Then finally when this God-awful movie was almost over and the  town people were gonna kill the werewolf they didn\\'t even show it. Don\\'t  ever think about buying this movie, i\\'d rent it with some friends and make  fun of it cuz that is all it is worth. The makers of the original  \"Howling\" must have crapped their pants when they saw this  movie.If you want a great werewolf movie get the original Howling or  American Werewolf in London.

        "  u'review_text': [u'Like the other reviewers, I am also achieving the benefits of Ms. Carter\\'s \"un\"workout.  This is the first yoga tape I\\'d ever purchased  (Feb. \\'99) and at first it took me a few times to get the feel of the  postures and where exactly I was going with  my focus.  I\\'d never done yoga  before or like, Ms. Carter, considered myself \"athletic\" in any  way.This tape always makes me sweat and I feel like I\\'ve worked every  muscle and strengthened and stretched everything possible. I\\'ve received  better muscle tone, less back trouble (as I sit at a desk all day), better  posture, my waist has gotten smaller love those side bends), and I just  feel good all over after an intense \"un\"workout.  I decided to  build my yoga library, and Ms. Carter\\'s followup tape was my second choice.  I recently added Bryan Kest\\'s Power Yoga 1 and Jane Fonda\\'s Yoga tape, so  I can alternate and still get a great workout from various instructors and  still get the overall sweating and \"sensations\". I also take one  day off a week to \"rest\", but on that day I do the P.M. portion  of Ms. Carter\\'s \"Unworkout II\" before bedtime for a good night\\'s  sleep.For beginners, this is **the** tape to start with and it still  remains my favorite due to Ms. Carter\\'s encouragement, instruction, and  sense of humour.',\n",
        "   u'Dixie Carter is very informative, funny and her voice is extremly relaxing  to listen to. As a first timer at this she explained everything very well  and made me feel very comfortable. This tape is well worth the money and I  would recomend it to anyone and everyone. You must buy this tape!',\n",
        "   u'This video is not only a workout, but it is also relaxing because of the good breathing one must do throughout the exercises. I enjoy this workout tape because Ms. Carter is an extremely good teacher, and she makes the  workout rewarding. The \"cool down\" phase at the end is spiritual  and uplifting! I highly recommend this to beginners.',\n",
        "   u'Doing this tape 2 - 3X a week has virtually eliminated my middle aged aches and pains; painful muscle stiffness which has plagued me most of my adult life (especially hands, neck, shoulders and back) is a thing of the past.  I always feel about an inch taller after I do this workout.  An added benefit:  I\\'m less grouchy.  I run, swim and do weights occasionally, but this is the tape that makes those things possible.  After you\\'ve done it about 50 times, you\\'ll want to fast forward through some of the longer explanations but I find Dixie\\'s voice and her music pleasant and soothing.  I\\'m forever grateful to this \"designing woman\".',\n",
        "   u\"I have both of Dixie Carter's tapes, and I must say that her tapes are the best yoga tapes I have tried.  She really knows it.  I am 60 years old and still get many admiring comments.\",\n",
        "   u\"I found the pace challenging and manageable.  The background colors, music and Dixie's lovely voice and sense of humor, helped me stick with it.  I simply envisioned myself at my personal spa with my personal trainer--a  woman I admire.\",\n",
        "   u'Miss Carter does a wonderful job of presenting this yoga-based, non-impact workout, adaptable to a variety of fitness levels. Her soothing southern accent, as she talks you through each exercise, helps to maintain the  relaxed, spiritual mood she encourages you to establish early in the video.  You learn body-cleansing breathing techniques, helpful for relaxation and  stress reduction.  The exercises progress into graceful stretching and  strengthening movements, always with the proper breathing techniques.  Expect to break a sweat - this \"unworkout\" is a workout.  As you  persist with this program, the movements become easier, without  compromising the benefits.  A slimmer, toned and more flexible you is the  outcome.  There were not many muscles missed when it came to stretching and  strenghtening!  The video winds down with more quiet time, leaving you  feeling spiritually refreshed, relaxed and with a great sense of  accomplishment. Although you can select the exercises you choose to do, it  is best to follow the video from start to finish. I allow one hour per  session. I highly recommend this video to anyone, of any age.  It has  provided me an opportunity to combine the the \"quiet time\" I need  to allow myself with the exercise I often neglect. As a sidenote... Miss  Carter says she performs her Yoga routine on a regular basis.  I believe  it.  I saw her show this past year in NY - she wore a very form-fitting  outfit and looked great!',\n",
        "   u'I have several yoga tapes and I love Dixie Carter\\'s Unworkout the best.  I actually enjoy the time I spend \"with\" Dixie.  There has been a noticable drop in my blood pressure (according to my family physician)  which I attribute to being able to release the tension that accumulates  after a day\\'s stress.'],\n",

        "   u\"If you're looking for practical techinques, this would be a valuable addition to get. Some extra commentaries would of been useful during some scenes, but the overall message is convied. If you don't take my word, then take a look yourself!\",\n",
        "   u'Great and clear on techniques. The only thing lacking upon this (which is why I only gave it 4 stars instead of 5) was some commentaries were needed when there were scenes showing randori, and the competitors never gave an explanation on how European Power techniques were used or incorporated in their art, there were only claims that they were there. The strong points were the names in both Japanese and Korean and the showing of the movements from different angles. Great camera work! I recommend it!',\n",
        "   u'In the Republic of Korea, Yudo is both a sport and a military art.  This video limits itself to the Olympic sport of Judo, which bears slight resemblance to the military art.  The failure to provide a proper history of the oriental art of Judo in Korea is deeply disappointing, especially since Korea is the only country in the world wherein the martial art created by Kano Jigoro is still taught as Kano intended it to be taught, as a military art.  If one wants a videotape which illustrates the Korean adaptation and practice of  the Olympic sport of judo, they may want to purchase this videocassette.  It is a unique production in that regard and belongs in the  collection of every sport judo competitior. If one wants to gain an understanding of the traditional military art of Yudo, as practiced in Korea for nearly a century, this videocassette is a total waste of money.',\n",

I exspected insight in different training methods and maybe unorthodox techniques.Instead , it shows somewhat lacklustre demonstrations of the most basic throws, a Korean coach explaining the point system in korean with subtitles. You then can watch the most boring randori session between a few teenagers, who throw each other again and again with O Soto.Boring!!\"],\n",

It\\'s true, there were no \"twirlies\" in it. It\\'s just faces, and she seems to like it just fine.',\n",
        "   u\"I'm not into showing my child much TV, but my infant started watching this video when she was only 2 months old, and she is still watching it at 5 months. I needed something like this, desperately. It is soothing, and it doesn't have the music that drives mother's crazy after multiple times. It is pretty basic, with baby faces one after the other, but that is all my baby needs right now.  I have some of the newer baby videos that are out, and I just rotate them around. I wouldn't recommend it for kids over a year old though. My toddler doesn't have an interest because she is moving around to much and likes things more upbeat.\",\n",
        "   u'I guess I could be described as an \"earth child\", and what I especially loved about it was that it wasn\\'t selling anything.  In this age of \"programming\" it was nice to have something to show to my 4-month old that held her attention, gave me a minute to get things done, but wasn\\'t sold by Disney or Sesame. It is simple and soothing. That\\'s what counts for me right now.',\n",
        "   u'WOW! WHAT A GREAT DAY IT WAS WHEN THIS VIDEO CAME TO MY DOOR. MY DAUGHTER FROM AGE 6 MOS TO OVER A YEAR OLD HAS LOVED THIS VIDEO. IT GIVES ME 30 MINS TO TAKE A SHOWER, READ A MAGAZINE OR JUST ENJOY WATCHING HER WATCH THE BABIES ON THE SCREEN. YOU HAVE TO GET THIS! IT IS WONDERFUL. I HAVE BOUGHT IT FOR ALL MY OTHER NEW MOM FRIENDS AS WELL!'],\n",

        "  u'review_text': [u'\"Confession Of An Assassin\" may be one of the most controversial films I have seen related with the JFK assassination. Not because it presents a new conspiracy theory, but because a man in here actually claims  to be one of the assassins! I really can\\'t say that I believe everything  the prisoner in this video says, some of it seems a little too off kilter.  Maybe he is telling the truth, who knows? Though I can\\'t give it five  stars, I still recommend you see it to make your own decision. Pay very  close attention and keep some skepticism in mind because this guy could be  a phony looking for a way out. I\\'m not saying he\\'s a liar, if this is the  truth, then it\\'s settled: A conspiracy killed John F. Kennedy. If it\\'s not,  then we should just put it aside. I would give this guy some support  considering time is running out and not much is left to build a big case.  \"Confession Of An Assassin\" is for the viewer to make up his  mind. I can\\'t say it\\'s a \"great\" piece, but I still recommend it.',\n",
        "   u'Let me start by saying, I\\'ve been a serious student of the JFK assassination for the last 27 years; I\\'ve read and re-read all the major books and articles including the great anti-conspiracy work of Posner\\'s, as well as the much vaunted Warren report; I\\'ve also seen all the major documentaries and most importantly,have THOUGHT many hundreds of hours about the case.As for the video in question, let me say this: although I am the most skeptical and \"doubting Thomas\" kind of guy you\\'ll ever meet, I find many compelling kernels of truth to James Files\\' (the subject of the video) interview---though I\\'m not quite ready to proclaim him as completely sincere yet.Yes, there are a few discrepancies in Files\\' story. However, the man\\'s recall of NON EVENTS would be extremely difficult to conjure up (if he were, indeed, lying). Simply put, a pathological individual who was simply making up a story wouldn\\'t be concerned with minute, trivial details, but with the larger picture. Files\\' not only has amazing recall of such little details, but when viewed as a mosaic of the larger picture, they all seems to fit. But another important element emerges in File\\'s remarkable story. Interestingly, I had always assumed that the Secret Service impersonator (in the Grassy Knoll) was, as a confederate in a larger conspiracy plot, used to protect the frontal shooter. My explanation to myself of the impersonator\\'s apparent brashness (when confronted by police) was simply that he must have had some real brass gonads, or simply stated, was so cocksure of his phony credentials\\' (and, perhaps, his relationship to a larger governmental or institutional conspiracy), that fear wasn\\'t really an issue. But innately, I\\'d always questioned this assumption without really knowing why.Enter in Files\\' revelations: not only do they shed new light on my assumptions (whether by truth or design), but they make me realize I had probably been viewing the whole Grassy knoll sequence in a skewered light. As Files\\' explains it, his presence in the knoll was only as a back-up---in case the assassination didn\\'t go down the way it was supposed to. Thus, the impersonator was also a back up and was to only be used if really necessary. Now, it all made sense to me: If Oswald was to be \"set up\" as the rear shooter, then a frontal gunman would NOT be expected to shoot, but only be used in a back-up mode. And this would also explain the inordinate \\'brashness\\' of the impersonator who only displayed his authentic-looking ID\\'s when he really HAD TO. Not a story likely created by someone so egotistical as wanting to feign involvement.How would Files have dreamed up this simple, yet remarkable observation if he were simply fictionalizing? Two explanations emerge: 1) either he IS, in fact, the frontal gunman and his actual participation provides true insight into what really happened; or 2) he is one of the most prolific liars AND students of the assassination (possessing an enormous database of info) to emerge in the last 3 decades. Problem is, Files simply doesn\\'t come across as being THAT sophisticated or book smart (although he does appear very street savvy). Whether File\\'s is, or isn\\'t telling the truth, his unique descriptions of the Grassy Knoll sequence put pieces of the puzzle into place in a way I have never heard anyone *else* suggest. This seeming familiarity with the event has an odd ring of truth to it and suggests in some form, an INTIMATE knowledge about the assassination. In conclusion: the only way File\\'s story could be corroborated would be if a second interview took place, and dozens of minute details mentioned in the first interview were presented to him for spontaneous validation.Whatever the outcome, this video is definitely a must see for any serious student of the JFK case. Decide for yourself. Read more \\u203a',\n",
        "   u\"This is a very compelling documentary. My opinion is that it is certainly worth a look. Decide for yourselves whether the man speaking to you, and looking you right in the eye sounds like he is full of it or not.Aside from the content: As far as I am concerned, people who are confessing to a heavy duty crime usually look just like him in many ways. Some of the mannerisms and physical reactions arent something people easily & conciously manifest.Aside from the fact that this guy knew PLENTY of details that average people just don't have any clue of, he knew many names, and plenty of details about the people. He knew a hell of a lot about the EXACT lay out of Dealy Plaza, entrances and exits, the train yeard, the exact identities of the hobos.............End analysis: Fully knowing I will be torn up from one end to the other by the skeptics, Im sorry, I found it compelling. It might not be the be all, end all of truth, but there is something there.I say it was worth every penny.\",\n",
        "   u\"I have read several books on the assassination over the years. The best was a book by a surgeon at Parkland hospital who discribed the entry wound to Kennedy's throat-the first thing he grabs-at Parland they enlarged the wound and used it to create a tracheotomy.He further describes the call from the inexperienced MD's doing the autopsy who did not know what had happened to Kennedy's throat. Also more importantly he decribes the head wound exit as obviously having a back of the head exit-I believe if you wee working on the president-actually there was not much they could do-you would certainly remember the  wound details. I believe the MD was Dr. Crenshaw. The nest best book was called Best Evidence-basically the brain might have given clues-but guess what, the National Archives lost the brain. I agree that Files seems to either have a vivid imagination or the details are factual. Hopefully more interviews will be forth-coming-this interview is credible-anyone who thinks Oswald got lucky is naive. I remeber one TV demonstration years ago where Military sharp-shooters could not duplicate Oswald's alledged feat. More confirmation is obviously needed. Hopefully someone will research Files.\",\n",
        "   u'I am probably not an impartial reviewer, since I know much more about this story than the average person.Therefore I know James Files has done the american public, freedom and democracy, a big favor by telling the truth. Whether it will ever reach the masses, is an entirely different question. The forces that have succesfully covered it up for 40 years are not sitting idle and can only be exposed by YOU, the people.'],\n",
